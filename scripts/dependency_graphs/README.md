# Dependency Graphs Generator

This script creates dependency graphs of internal crates.
It creates a SVG file per crate in case the crate itself has dependencies.
All crated files are listed in an autogenerated index.html file.
Hyperlinks are added in the SVG files to easily navigate through the dependencies.

## Requirements

- You need to have graphviz installed.

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz   # on debian/ubuntu
```
