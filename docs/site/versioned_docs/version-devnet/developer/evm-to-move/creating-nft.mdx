## How this works in Solidity / EVM

NFTs (Non-Fungible-Tokens) are a popular building block commonly used in the EVM ecosystem. The most widely used standard on EVM-based chains is the ERC-721 standard, which allows a smart contract to mint and transfer NFTs with some basic metadata. These standard NFTs can be used on many different platforms in a common way to be viewed, traded, and used in other ways. 

Here's an example of a typical ERC-721 NFT built with Solidity on an EVM chain:

```solidity title="contracts/MyNFT.sol"
pragma solidity ^0.8.3;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") {}

    function mintNFT(address recipient, string memory tokenURI) public onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
        _tokenIds.increment();

        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
        _mint(recipient, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);

        return newItemId;
    }
}
```

In this example, we can see that we are using the widely accepted and trusted [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) library to abstract some of the logic surrounding an ERC721 away. The contract inherits from `Ownable` and `ERC721`, making it compatible with the standard and 'owned', giving the owner some extra powers (in this case, to call the `mintNFT` function). The ERC721 is created with the constructor, and the `mintNFT` function creates a new ERC721 NFT for us and assigns it to the provided address. It also takes the `tokenURI` argument which is supposed to contain a URL to a JSON file containing some metadata about this NFT (this is typically not on-chain). All created NFTs are stored within the state of this contract in a mapping where the ID of the NFT points towards its owner and the `tokenURI` for more information about the specific NFT.

A lot of logic here is abstracted away, but every bit of logic can be overwritten - similar to the ERC-20 example. There's little enforcement of anything, which could lead to undesired situations. Also, using off-chain metadata means that if that data becomes unavailable, that data is lost, which is undesirable. There is no enforcement of the TokenURI contents either, meaning you can't rely on the contents being valid for what you wish to use the NFT for.

## How to NFT with IOTA Move

IOTA Move is based on objects instead of a global storage like EVM. Objects in IOTA Move can be owned, non-fungible, and unique - the exact properties of an NFT! This makes creating NFTs in IOTA Move very trivial, given that everything is already an NFT by default. An example of a very simplified NFT in IOTA Move:

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/evm-to-move/sources/nft.move
```

This is just a simplified NFT that anyone can mint, with just a name in it as metadata. It can freely be transferred and burned, and the metadata can be directly accessed through the object from another contract. Given that this is just a normal object being created, there's little to add to this code example. It's straightforward if you know the basics of working with objects in IOTA. 

### Using Object Display

The framework has a built-in feature to represent objects with templates that can be easily used for off-chain use. This allows you to save the most important data like IDs in your objects and construct, for example, a templated URL and Image URL inside a JSON object out of that without needing to host a JSON file off-chain. These templates can also be modified later if things change, making this setup much more decentralized and future-proof than using the standard `tokenURI` in an ERC-721 implementation linking to a JSON file. You can learn more about using Object Display [in the documentation](../standards/display.mdx).

## Differences, pitfalls, pros and cons

To sum up the most important differences between the two approaches:

| Non-enforced standard functionality (you can implement the ERC-721 functions as you please, including in for users' undesired ways) | Enforced standard functionality for objects with customizability where needed.                                                          |

NFTs in Move are clearly a big improvement over the afterthought counterparts in the EVM/Solidity ecosystem. There are more assurances and better usability when it comes to asset management.
