# Creating In-Game Currency

You can use the IOTA [Closed-Loop Token](../../standards/closed-loop-token.mdx) standard
to develop in-game currencies like gems or diamonds commonly found in mobile games.
These tokens can be awarded to players for their actions or made available for purchase.
While minted on the IOTA network, players can only use these tokens within the game's ecosystem.
Typically, such tokens are non-transferable and are minted in predefined quantities to maintain scarcity and balance within the game.

## Setting Up the GEM Currency

In the following example creates an in-game currency called `GEM`, representing a specific amount of IOTA.
Players can purchase fungible `GEMs` using IOTA, which they can then spend within the game.

### Example Overview

The IOTA repository includes a [basic example of creating an in-game currency]https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/examples/move/token.
The Move modules responsible for establishing the game's economy are located in the [`gems.move`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/examples/move/token/sources/gems.move) source file.

### The `examples::sword` Module

The [`examples::sword` module](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/examples/move/token/sources/gems.move#L8) defines an in-game object, a `sword`,
which holds value within the game.
This module assigns a `GEM` value to the sword and includes the logic for trading `GEMs` to acquire a sword.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/token/sources/gems.move#L8-L32
```

### The `examples::gem` Module

The [`examples::gem` module](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/examples/move/token/sources/gems.move#L36) is responsible
for creating the `GEM` in-game currency.
Players spend IOTA to purchase `GEMs`, which they can trade for swords or other in-game items.
The module defines three tiers of `GEM` packages—small, medium, and large—each representing different in-game values.
Constants within the module specify both the value and the quantity of GEMs in each package.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/token/sources/gems.move#L73-L69
```

#### Initializing the GEM Currency

The `init` function in the module uses `coin::create_currency` to create the GEM currency. This function runs only once upon module publication. It sets the policies for the in-game currency, freezes the coin's metadata, and transfers the policy capability to the package publisher.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/token/sources/gems.move#L76-L100
```

#### Purchasing GEMs

The module handles the purchase of `GEMs` through the `buy_gems` function.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/token/sources/gems.move#L104-L125
```
