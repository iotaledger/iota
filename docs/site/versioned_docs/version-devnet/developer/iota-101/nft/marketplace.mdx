# Marketplace Extension

The Marketplace Extension for [IOTA Kiosk](../../standards/kiosk.mdx) is a customizable framework that extends the functionality of the IOTA Kiosk by enabling efficient asset trading with integrated royalty management and pricing mechanism.

Kiosk owners can list items for sale by setting prices, and enforce royalties, ensuring creators receive a percentage of each sale. Buyers can securely purchase items, with the extension validating payments and handling royalties automatically. All transactions are governed by robust transfer policies, ensuring security and compliance.
