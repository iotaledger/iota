# Get Test Tokens

You can test apps on the IOTA network using IOTA Wallet. The wallet supports connections to IOTA Testnet, IOTA Devnet, a [Local network](../../../developer/getting-started/local-network.mdx), or a Custom RPC URL for a network you create.

## Change the Active Network Connection

To switch the network in your IOTA Wallet:

1. Click the settings cog icon in the top-right corner of the IOTA Wallet.
2. Select `Network`.

## Get IOTA Tokens for Testing

When you first open the wallet, it will have no coins. You can add test IOTA coins for testing purposes. These test tokens have no real-world value and can only be used on the specific network they were obtained from, like Devnet or Testnet.

### Request IOTA Test Coins Using the Wallet

1. After installing the wallet extension, choose either Devnet or Testnet from the network options.
2. If your wallet has no coins, a button will appear allowing you to request tokens.
3. Click `Request Devnet IOTA tokens` or `Request Testnet IOTA tokens`, based on the network you're using.

4. Once tokens are in your wallet, the button to request more will move to the `Settings` page. Access it by clicking the cog icon in the top-right corner of the wallet interface.
