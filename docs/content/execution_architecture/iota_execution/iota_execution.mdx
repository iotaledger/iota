## IOTA Execution Architecture

The IOTA Execution Architecture, depicted in the included architectural diagram, outlines the technical approach for the iota execution crate to have a general view of component interaction. 
Here we have a visual representation of the iota_execution crate with its subcrates (iota_adapter, iota_move_natives, iota_verifier).
