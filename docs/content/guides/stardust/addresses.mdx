## Addresses

In IOTA Stardust, addresses were represented in either Bech32 address format (for example `iota1qrhacyfwlcnzkvzteumekfkrrwks98mpdm37cj4xx3drvmjvnep6xqgyzyx`), or hex format (for example `0xefdc112efe262b304bcf379b26c31bad029f616ee3ec4aa6345a366e4c9e43a3`), where the hash is based on the 32 byte BLAKE2b-256 hash of the ed25519 public key of the address owner, or the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the Output ID for a NFT or Alias address. This new protocol version retains the same hex format for addresses but deprecates the Bech32 format. 

### Bech32 to Hex conversion

It's possible to convert a legacy Bech32 address back to hex format. To do this you take the part after `iota1` or `smr1`, base32 decode it, and strip away the last 6 digits containing the checksum. You are left with a 33-byte hex string now where the first byte represents the address type (`0x00`) which can be stripped too. You are left with the 32 bytes which, in hex format, represents an address. 

## Keys

Key-pair derivation in IOTA remains similar to what it was before but supports more signing schemes now. The standard signing scheme is still ed25519 and key derivation is still implemented following SLIP-0010 and BIP-32 standards. 

The following key derivation path is used for example to fetch a first keypair for an IOTA wallet using the ed25519 keypair, the same as what it was in Stardust:

`44'/4218'/0'/0'/0'`

The `44` represents ed25519, the `4218` represents the IOTA Coin Type (`4219` for SMR). The first `0'` is the account, the second is the change, and the last `0'` represents the address index starting at 0, for a new address you'd increment this one.

This key derivation path, together with a 24-word BIP-39 mnemonic (the same as with Stardust), a new key pair can be derived. 

Once a key pair has been derived the public key can be BLAKE2b-256 hashed leaving you with a 32-byte hex address. This retains full compatibility with existing keys and hex addresses from Stardust. For any other signing scheme, besides the default ed25519 one, a flag is appended before hashing the public key with BLAKE2b-256. You can find all the details in the [Signatures section](../../concepts/cryptography/transaction-auth/signatures.mdx) of the documentation.
