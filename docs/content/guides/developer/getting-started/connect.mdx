title: Connect to a IOTA Network
description: Besides Mainnet, IOTA offers Testnet, Devnet, and local networks that you can connect to for development. You can also configure a custom RPC endpoint.

import DataWipe from "../../../_snippets/data-wipe.mdx";

IOTA has Mainnet, Devnet, and Testnet networks available. You can use one of the test networks, Devnet or Testnet, to experiment with the version of IOTA running on that network. You can also spin up a [local IOTA network](./local-network.mdx) for local development. 

The IOTA Testnet and Devnet networks consist of four validator nodes operated by Mysten Labs. Clients send transactions and read requests via this endpoint: `https://fullnode.<IOTA-NETWORK-VERSION>.iota.io:443` using [JSON-RPC](/references/iota-api/json-rpc-format.mdx).

You can [request test IOTA tokens](#request-test-tokens) through the IOTA [devnet-faucet](https://discordapp.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) and [testnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) Discord channels, depending on which version of the network you use. If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from your [local faucet](./local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet). The coins on these networks have no financial value. There is no faucet service for Mainnet.

See announcements about IOTA in the [#announcements](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/925109817834631189) Discord channel.

See the [terms of service](https://iota.io/terms/) for using IOTA networks.

## IOTA CLI

IOTA provides [IOTA command line interface (CLI)](/references/cli/client.mdx) to interact with IOTA networks:

- Create and manage your private keys
- Create example NFTs
- Call and publish Move modules


## Environment set up

First, [Install IOTA](./iota-install.mdx#install-binaries). After you install IOTA, [request IOTA test tokens](#request-gas-tokens) through Discord for the network you are using: [Devnet](https://discordapp.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) or [Testnet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966). If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from your [local faucet](./local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet).

To check whether IOTA is already installed, run the following command:

```shell
which iota
```

If IOTA is installed, the command returns the path to the IOTA binary. If IOTA is not installed, it returns `iota not found`.

See the [IOTA Releases](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/releases) page to view the changes in each IOTA release.

## Configure IOTA client

If you previously ran `iota genesis` to create a local network, it created a IOTA client configuration file (client.yaml) that connects to `localhost` at `http://0.0.0.0:9000`. See [Connect to a custom RPC endpoint](#connect-to-a-custom-rpc-endpoint) to update the client.yaml file.

To connect the IOTA client to a network, run the following command:

```shell
iota client
```

If you receive the `iota-client` help output in the console, you already have a client.yaml file. See [Connect to a custom RPC endpoint](#connect-to-a-custom-rpc-endpoint) to add a new environment alias or to switch the currently active network.

The first time you start IOTA client without having a client.yaml file, the console displays the following message:

```
Config file ["<PATH-TO-FILE>/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a IOTA Full node server [y/N]?
```

Press **y** and then press **Enter**. The process then requests the RPC server URL: 

```
IOTA Full node server URL (Defaults to IOTA Devnet if not specified) :
```

Press **Enter** to connect to IOTA Devnet. To use a custom RPC server, IOTA Testnet, or IOTA Mainnet, enter the URL to the correct RPC endpoint and then press **Enter**.

If you enter a URL, the process prompts for an alias for the environment:

```
Environment alias for [<URL-ENTERED>] :
```
Type an alias name and press **Enter**.

```
Select key scheme to generate keypair (0 for ed25519, 1 for secp256k1, 2 for secp256r1):
```

Press **0**, **1**, or **2** to select a key scheme and the press **Enter**.

IOTA returns a message similar to the following (depending on the key scheme you selected) that includes the address and 12-word recovery phrase for the address:

```
Generated new keypair for address with scheme "ed25519" [0xb9c83a8b40d3263c9ba40d551514fbac1f8c12e98a4005a0dac072d3549c2442]
Secret Recovery Phrase : [cap wheat many line human lazy few solid bored proud speed grocery]
```

### Connect to a custom RPC endpoint

If you previously used `iota genesis` with the force option (`-f` or `--force`), your client.yaml file already includes two RPC endpoints: `localnet` at `http://0.0.0.0:9000` and `devnet` at `https://fullnode.devnet.iota.io:443`. You can view the defined environments with the `iota client envs` command, and switch between them with the `iota client switch` command.

If you previously installed a IOTA client that connected to a IOTA network, or created a local network, you can modify your existing client.yaml file to change the configured RPC endpoint. The `iota client` commands that relate to environments read from and write to the client.yaml file.

To check currently available environment aliases, run the following command: 

```sh
iota client envs
```

The command outputs the available environment aliases, with `(active)` denoting the currently active network.
```sh
localnet => http://0.0.0.0:9000 (active)
devnet => https://fullnode.devnet.iota.io:443
```

To add a new alias for a custom RPC endpoint, run the following command. Replace values in `<` `>` with values for your installation:

```shell
iota client new-env --alias <ALIAS> --rpc <RPC-SERVER-URL>
```

To switch the active network, run the following command:

```shell
iota client switch --env <ALIAS>
```

If you encounter an issue, delete the IOTA configuration directory (`~/.iota/iota_config`) and reinstall the latest [IOTA binaries](./iota-install.mdx#install-iota-binaries).
