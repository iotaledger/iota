# Native NFT and ERC721

The IOTA L1 can create NFTs, also called native NFTs. To use these NFTs on L2, you have
an ERC20 contract called `ERC721NFTs`, which contains all L1 NFTs owned by the chain. The following guides will show you how to [mint your own L1 NFT from L2](./mint-nft.md) and [use](./use-as-erc721.md) it with the `ERC721NFTs` contract.
