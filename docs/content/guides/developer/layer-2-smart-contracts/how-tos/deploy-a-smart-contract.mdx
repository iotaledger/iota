# Deploy a Smart Contract

You can deploy your smart contracts to any of your [EVM chains](/build/networks-endpoints/) using popular tools like [Remix](#remix)
and [Hardhat](#hardhat).

This guide will deploy the `Counter` contract you can find in
the [How to Create a Basic Solidity Contract Guide](create-a-basic-contract.md).

Deploying a Solidity smart contract using Remix is a straightforward process that doesn't require any installation or
setup of development environments on your machine. Remix is a powerful, browser-based IDE that allows you to write,
compile, and deploy smart contracts.

### 1. Connect to Metamask

Before you get started, make sure you have connected Metamask to your network of choice.

:::tip Networks & Endpoints

You can check the connection details in the [Networks & Endpoints section](/build/networks-endpoints/).

### 2. Access Remix IDE

Open your web browser and navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

### 3. Create Your Smart Contract

1. In the `File Explorer` tab on the left, click the `Create New File` icon.
2. Name your file `Counter.sol`.
3. Copy the Solidity code for the [basic counter smart contract](create-a-basic-contract.md) and paste it into
   the `Counter.sol` file you just created in Remix.

### 4. Compile Your Smart Contract

1. Navigate to the `Solidity Compiler` tab on the left sidebar.
2. Select the appropriate compiler version that matches the version specified in your contract (`^0.8.6` or similar).
   You might need to enable "Auto compile" or click the "Compile" button manually.
3. If there are errors, Remix will display them, and you'll need to correct them before proceeding.

### 5. Deploy Your Smart Contract

1. Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab on the left sidebar.
2. In the "Environment" dropdown, select and select `Injected Web3` from the `Environment` dropdown.

   ![Select Injected Provider from the Environment dropdown](/img/evm/remix-injected-provider-metamask.png)
   
3. After selecting the environment, make sure the contract Counter is selected in the `Contract` dropdown.
4. Click the `Deploy` button. If you're using an Ethereum network, confirm the transaction in your Web3 wallet.

### 6. Interact with Your Deployed Contract

Once deployed, the contract instance will appear under the `Deployed Contracts` section.
Here, you can interact with your contract by calling its functions. For the Counter contract, you'll see buttons to call
its `increment`, `decrement`, and `getCount` functions directly from Remix.

The first thing you'll need to deploy a smart contract using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is to set up a Hardhat
project. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### 1. Set Up Hardhat

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Create a new directory for your project, and navigate into it. For example:
   ```bash
   mkdir deploy-a-basic-contract &&
   cd deploy-a-basic-contract
   ```
3. Create a new node project by running:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
4. Install Hardhat by running:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```
5. Create a Hardhat Project by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat init
   ```

   Select `Create a JavaScript project` (or whatever applies to your project) when prompted and answer the setup questions (you can press enter to
   accept defaults).

### 2. Add Your Contract

1. Inside the `contracts` folder, create a new file called  `Counter.sol` and paste the content of
   the [Counter Basic Contract](create-a-basic-contract.md).

### 3. Create a Deployment Script

1. Navigate to the `scripts` folder.
2. Create a new file called `deploy.js` with the following code:

   ```javascript
   async function main() {
       const Counter = await ethers.getContractFactory("Counter");
       const counter = await Counter.deploy();
   
       console.log("Counter deployed to:", await counter.getAddress());
   }
   
   main()
       .then(() => process.exit(0))
       .catch((error) => {
           console.error(error);
           process.exit(1);
       });
   ```

### 4. Compile and Deploy Your Contract

1. Add your preferred network parameters to the `hardhat.config.js`, for example:

<HardhatConfig/>

:::info Export the Metamask Private Key

1. Click on the Metamask logo in the upper right corner.
2. Select the account you want to export.
3. On the account page, click the menu (three dots) in the upper right corner, then click the "Account Details" button.
4. Click on "Export Private Key".
5. Enter your wallet password to access your private key and click `Confirm` to continue.
6. Your private key will now be displayed. Click to copy it and save it in a safe place. 

You can find more information in the [official Metamask Documentation](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/).

:::

:::caution

Currently, there is no validation service available for EVM/Solidity smart contracts on IOTA Smart Contracts, which is
often offered through block explorer APIs.

:::

2. Compile your contract by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. If you have no compilation errors, you can deploy your contract by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network evm-testnet
   ```

   **Expected output**:

   ```bash
   Counter deployed to: 0x123456789ABCDEFGHIJK123456789ABCDEFGHIJK
   ```
   ***** `0x123456789ABCDEFGHIJK123456789ABCDEFGHIJK` is the contract unlock address.

4. You can verify your contract by visiting
   the [EVM Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/),
   and searching for the address from the previous step. If you access the `Contract` tab, you should be able to see
   your code and interact with your contract.
