# Revoke a Verifiable Credential

The [example](#example) below demonstrates two methods that an issuer can use to revoke a verifiable credential
using the IOTA Identity Framework:

1. By using the [`credentialStatus`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status) field in a credential and linking
to a [revocation method](#revocation-methods).
2. By [removing the verification method](#removing-the-verification-method) that signed the credential.
This invalidates all credentials that were signed with that verification method.

## Revocation methods
The IOTA Identity Framework supports two different revocation methods: `RevocationBitmap2022` and `StatusList2021`. 
### Revocation Bitmap
[RevocationBitmap2022](../../references/specifications/revocation-bitmap-2022.mdx) is the default credential revocation method used in the IOTA Identity Framework. It allows
issuers to control whether a credential is _valid_ or _revoked_. To do so, a revocation list (represented
as a bitmap) is stored in the issuer's DID document.
When a credential is issued, a unique index from the issuer's revocation list
is chosen, linking the credential's status to the value of the list entry. To change the status of a credential, the issuer
simply updates the corresponding entry in its revocation list.

With `RevocationBitmap2022` the `identity.rs` library completely handles the processes required to handle credentials revocation;
from creation and storage of the revocation list to its lookup. 
This makes `RevocationBitmap2022` the preferred way for users to handle credential revocation, but it requires sufficient
funds to rent out the required on-tangle space.

:::note

DLT's size constraints limit the size of the revocation list. With the assumption of only one such revocation list
per the issuer's DID document, one may expect to be able to handle roughly 50k entries.

If the binary value of the index in the bitmap is 1 (one), the verifiable credential is revoked,
if it is 0 (zero) it is not revoked.

For example, with this approach the issuer adds an index to a credential in the `credentialStatus` field, such as `"5"`.
This part of the credential might then look like this:

```json
"credentialStatus": {
  "id": "did:iota:EvaQhPXXsJsGgxSXGhZGMCvTt63KuAFtaGThx6a5nSpw#revocation",
  "type": "RevocationBitmap2022",
  "revocationBitmapIndex": "5"
},
```

The verifier uses the `id` field (`did:iota:EvaQhPXXsJsGgxSXGhZGMCvTt63KuAFtaGThx6a5nSpw#revocation`) to look up the
service in the issuer's DID document:

```json
{
  "id": "did:iota:EvaQhPXXsJsGgxSXGhZGMCvTt63KuAFtaGThx6a5nSpw#revocation",
  "type": "RevocationBitmap2022",
  "serviceEndpoint": "data:application/octet-stream;base64,ZUp5ek1tQmdZR1NBQUFFZ1ptVUFBQWZPQUlF"
}
```

During verification, the verifier decodes the revocation bitmap embedded in the `data` URL.
This bitmap written as a bitstring looks like this: `000001`.
Here, the 5th bit is set, which means the credential with that index is revoked,
while all other credentials aren't revoked.

### StatusList2021
[StatusList2021](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-vc-status-list-20230427) offers similar functionalities to `RevocationBitmap2022`
but in a more flexible and scalable way. 
The main difference is that `StatusList2021` is completely agnostic in regards to how the issuer's status list
is stored and fetched, as long as its location can be encoded through a URL. For instance, the status list
can be made available over HTTP (e.g. `https://example.com/credentials/status`) or through the
Interplanetary File System (e.g. `ipfs://QmXDWGdVBhbDoXXzKNMhJk5ejnZgxpMBVzW4EhQaHPD3Mi`).

This flexibility, although it requires the issuer to manually fetch and update its status list, allows for an arbitrary number of
entries in the status list, in contrast with `RevocationBitmap2022`, where the length of the list is limited by the DLT's constraints.

Furthermore, `StatusList2021` introduces a new credential state: _suspended_. Suspended credentials are credentials that a validator will not accept as _valid_, but that might become valid again in the future. Instead, _revoked_ credentials **cannot** ever
be valid again, as the _revoked_ state is irreversible.

First, an issuer creates a credential that encodes a certain status list, specifying its purpose (either `revocation` or `suspension`)
and the location at which it will be available (`https://example.com/credentials/status` in this case). After creation, the issuer
must make the credential available at the chosen URL so that verifiers can fetch it.

Upon issuing a credential, to revoke it or suspend it later, the issuer sets the `credentialStatus` field, linking
to an entry in its status list. The snippet below shows what `credentialStatus` would look like when linking to the previously created
status list credential. 

```json
{
    "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status#94567",
    "type": "StatusList2021Entry",
    "statusPurpose": "revocation",
    "statusListIndex": "94567",
    "statusListCredential": "https://example.com/credentials/status"
}
```

```

To set the status of a credential, the issuer retrieves the status list credential and sets the value of the chosen entry index.

## Removing the Verification Method

A less efficient alternative is to remove the verification method that signed the credential from the DID Document of
the issuer.
This means the VC can no longer be validated.

However, this will also invalidate every VC signed with that verification method,
meaning that the issuer will have to sign every VC with a different key to retain
precise control over which credential is revoked.
