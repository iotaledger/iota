# Send Funds From L1 to L2

There are multiple types of assets available on both IOTA L1 and L2, here we discuss a few of them, and how to get them
onto L2.

If you want to fund your EVM Testnet account using the EVM Toolkit, please refer to our [Testnet Quickstart Guide](../getting-started/quick-start.mdx)

## Fund an Ethereum Account on a IOTA Smart Contracts Chain

To send EVM transactions, you need to have an Ethereum address that owns tokens on the ISC chain (L2). These tokens will
be used to cover gas fees.

<TabItem value='firefly' label='Firefly'>

You can use your [Firefly Wallet](https://firefly.iota.org/) to easily send L1 IOTA or SMR to your L2 IOTA EVM or ShimmerEVM account.

#### Requirements

* [IOTA Tokens](/get-started/introduction/iota/iota-token/) or [Shimmer Tokens](/get-started/introduction/shimmer/shimmer-token/)
* [Firefly Wallet](https://firefly.iota.org/)
* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)

1. The first thing you will need to do is add the EVM to Metamask by hitting the following button.

2. Once you have added the EVM to Metamask, you can get your address:
