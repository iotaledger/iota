# Create ERC721 NFTs

:::info EVM-only NFT

Please keep in mind that this is an EVM-only NFT. It's not tied to L1 native assets. Also, these are different from L1
NFTs.

## About ERC721

Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are a type of token that can represent any unique object, including a real-world asset on a
decentralized network. NFTs are commonly represented by the ([ERC721 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)).
You can use the
openzepplin
lib [`@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol)
to streamline your development experience.

You can also use the ([OpenZepplin Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721)) to generate and customize
your smart contracts.

## Create the Smart Contract

The following is an example NFT Smart Contract called "IotaEVMSampleNFT".

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.1/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.1/access/Ownable.sol";

contract IotaEVMSampleNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 private _nextTokenId;

    constructor(address initialOwner)
    ERC721("IotaEVMSampleNFT", "SSNFT")
    Ownable(initialOwner)
    {}

    function _baseURI() internal pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "https://example.com/nft/";
    }

    function safeMint(address to) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

As you can see above, the contract uses standard methods for the most part. You should pay attention to the following:

- `pragma solidity ^0.8.20;`: This line means the contract uses solidity compiler version `0.8.20` or above.
- `contract IotaEVMSampleNFT is ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, Ownable`: This line defines the contract's name, and what
  other contracts it implements.
- `ERC721("IotaEVMSampleNFT", "SNFT") {}`: This line defines the token name and symbol. You can name it
  whatever you want. We recommend using the same name for the token and the contract.
- `return "https://example.com/nft/";`: You should define the base URI of your NFTs. That means the URL you provide here
  will be used for all your tokens. Since this contract uses auto-incremental token IDs, your token URI will look
  something like `https://example.com/nft/0`, `https://example.com/nft/1`, `https://example.com/nft/2`, and so on.
- `function safeMint(address to, string memory uri) public onlyOwner {`: The `safeMint` function will
  require that you manually input a token's `to` address and a `uri` every time you want to mint. This should work for
  regular use cases.

### Customize on OpenZeppelin

You can customize your contract depending on how you want it to behave. You should consider the following topics
and questions:

1. **Ownership** — Who owns it? How is it stored?
2. **Creation** — Method or Type of Creation.
3. **Transfer & Allowance** — How will tokens be transferred? How will they be available to other addresses and
   accounts?
4. **Burn** — Do you want to destroy it? If yes, how?

You can click on `Copy to Clipboard` and paste it into the IDE of your choice, download it, or click on `Open in Remix`
directly.


:::note Set the Initial Owner

Before you can deploy this contract, you will need to set the `Initial Owner` address; this can be your own IOTA EVM address.

### Mint Your Custom NFTs

So far, you have [created](#create-the-smart-contract) and deployed the contract. But, you probably want to mint some NFTs.
To do, you should:

1. Open the contract (listed under `Deployed Contracts`).
2. Insert your target IOTA EVM in beside the `safeMint` button and then click the button.

3. Confirm the transaction on Metamask.

   ![Confirm in metamask](/img/evm/how-tos/ERC721/confirm-in-metamask.png)

If you visit your address in the visit the [IOTA EVM Explorer](https://explorer.evm.iota.org),
[ShimmerEVM Explorer](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/) or  [EVM Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/)
you should see your NFTs listed under `Tokens`.
