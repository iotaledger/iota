title: From Solidity/EVM to Move
---

Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) have been at the core of smart contract development for some years now. Complete ecosystems have been built around it, mainly by bringing the composable building blocks to it to facilitate Decentralised Finance (DeFi). Move is a pretty new contenter in the space, and while certainly not the first attempt to take the place of Solidity it does do a lot of things right that will help developers, projects and end-users to set a new standard when it comes to smart contracts, be it in safety, usability or feature-wise.

If this sounds good to you you are in the right place. This guide will take you through to process of practically applying IOTA Move from a Solidity developer perspective. Let's get started!
