The projects are grouped by stack type and are sorted by complexity.

:::

### Full-stack apps
- [Distributed Counter](./app-examples/e2e-counter.mdx): An end-to-end example that creates a basic decentralized counter that anyone can increment, but only the object owner can reset it. The example includes Move code to create the package and leverages the Iota TypeScript SDK to provide a basic frontend.
- [Trustless Swap](./app-examples/trustless-swap.mdx): This example demonstrates trustless swaps on the Iota blockchain using a shared object as an escrow account.
- [Coin Flip](./app-examples/coin-flip.mdx): The Coin Flip app demonstrates on-chain randomness.
- [Reviews Rating](./app-examples/reviews-rating.mdx): This example demonstrates implementing a reviews-rating platform for the food service industry on Iota.
- [Blackjack](./app-examples/blackjack.mdx): This example demonstrates the logic behind an on-chain version of the popular casino card game, Blackjack.
- [Plinko](./app-examples/plinko.mdx): This example puts the classic Plinko game on chain, demonstrating use of cryptography-based strategies to create a fair and transparent game of chance. 

### Smart contracts
- [Tic-tac-toe](./app-examples/tic-tac-toe.mdx): Three implementations of the classic tic-tac-toe game on the Iota network to demonstrate different approaches to user interaction.

### Smart contracts & Backend
- [Weather Oracle](./app-examples/weather-oracle.mdx): The Iota Weather Oracle demonstrates how to create a basic weather oracle that provides real-time weather data.
