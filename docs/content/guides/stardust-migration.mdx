 description: Describes the migration from IOTA Stardust to the IOTA Move-based ledger.

The (legacy) IOTA and Shimmer networks run the Stardust protocol version that represents assets and tokens in a UTXO-based ledger.
IOTA Rebase introduces the Move-based object ledger, which necessitates the migration of assets and tokens from the Stardust ledger to the Move-based ledger.

The following pages describe the automated asset migration process into the new ledger model and serve as a guide for
developers on how to use the new models and handle assets.
