- **RAM:** 128 GB
- **CPU:** 24-core processor
- **Storage:** 4 TB
- **Network Uplink:** 1 Gbps
- **Minimum Stake:** 2 million IOTAs (can be achieved through delegation)

## 4. What happens to the existing IOTA EVM?

The [IOTA EVM](https://wiki.iota.org/isc/introduction/) on Layer 2 will:

- **Continue Operating:** It will eventually run alongside the new IOTA Rebased Layer 1.
- **Integration Plans:** Future plans include integrating EVM capabilities directly into Layer 1.
- **Temporary Pause During Upgrade:** The EVM chain will be paused and upgraded but will resume normal operations
  afterward.

## 5. What are the key features introduced with IOTA Rebased?

Key features include:

- **L1 Smart Contracts:** Smart contract capabilities directly on the Layer 1 network using MoveVM.
- **[Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS)](./tokenomics/proof-of-stake.mdx):** A fully decentralized network governed by validators and stakers.
- **[Enhanced Tokenomics](./tokenomics//tokenomics.mdx):** Staking rewards, transaction fees with fee-burning, and storage deposits.
- **[Improved Security and Performance](./iota-architecture/iota-security.mdx):** Resilient [consensus](./iota-architecture/consensus.mdx) mechanisms, fairer gas pricing, and dynamic validator selection.

## 6. Why is IOTA moving to the MoveVM and an object-based architecture?

The shift to the MoveVM and an object-based architecture is designed to:

- **Enhance Flexibility and Programmability:** Allow complex applications to be written via smart contracts directly on L1.
- **Support Advanced Use Cases:** Enable sophisticated financial instruments, decentralized exchanges, and intricate supply chain systems.
- **Improve Security:** Leverage MoveVM features like resource-oriented programming and static verification to enhance security.
- **Simplify Development:** Provide strong data abstraction capabilities and support for formal verification, improving the developer experience.

## 7. How will the tokenomics change under the IOTA Rebased proposal?

The new tokenomics model includes:

- **[Staking Rewards](./tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx):** Validators and delegators receive newly minted IOTA tokens as rewards (approximately 767,000 IOTAs per epoch), resulting in an initial annual inflation rate of about 6%.
- **[Transaction Fees](./tokenomics/gas-in-iota.mdx):** Small fees are charged on transactions (around 0.005 IOTA for an average transaction) and are burned to create deflationary pressure.
- **[Storage Deposits](./tokenomics/gas-in-iota.mdx#storage-units):** A redeemable deposit is required for storage, similar to the storage deposit system used in IOTA Stardust.

## 8. How does staking work in the new tokenomics model?

Staking involves:

- **[Delegation to Validators](./tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx):** Token holders can delegate their tokens to validators to help secure the network.
- **[Earning Rewards](./tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx#validator-pool-rewards):** Both validators and their delegators receive staking rewards from newly minted tokens.
- **Proportional Distribution:** Rewards are distributed based on the amount of stake and validator commissions.

## 9. How will the new fee-burning mechanism work?

The fee-burning mechanism:

- **Burns Transaction Fees:** Collected fees are burned, reducing the overall token supply.
- **Deflationary Effect:** Increased network usage leads to more fees burned, creating deflationary pressure.
- **Supply Dynamics:** The mechanism balances inflation from staking rewards and deflation from fee burning.

## 10. How will the introduction of transaction fees affect users?

Transaction fees are minimal and serve as a congestion control mechanism:

- **Low Fees:** Approximately 0.005 IOTA per average transaction.
- **Fee Burning:** Fees are burned to reduce the total supply, creating deflationary pressure.
- **Staking Rewards Offset Fees:** Users can earn staking rewards that may exceed the cost of transaction fees.
- **Sponsored Transactions:** Developers can cover transaction fees on behalf of users, allowing for feeless user experiences.

## 11. How will this affect current token holders?

For current token holders:

- **Balances Maintained:** All balances will be migrated to the new network without loss.
- **Same Private Keys:** Users can access their tokens using their existing private keys in the new IOTA Wallet.
- **[Staking Opportunities](./about-iota/tokenomics/validators-staking):** Token holders can participate in staking or delegation to earn rewards.

## 12. Will there be any migration steps for users?

No manual migration is needed:

- **Seamless Transition:** The [migration process](../developer/stardust/stardust-migration.mdx) is designed to be automatic.
- **New Wallet Access:** Users will need to use the new [IOTA Wallet](./iota-wallet/getting-started.mdx) and can import their existing mnemonics or private keys.

## 13. Will transaction fees impact the feeless nature of IOTA?

Yes, but:

- **Minimal Impact:** Fees are very low and designed as a congestion control mechanism.
- **Net Gain for Users:** Staking rewards can offset transaction fees, potentially resulting in more tokens than before.
- **Sponsored Transactions:** Developers can sponsor fees, allowing users to transact without holding IOTA tokens.

## 14. How will the governance vote work?

The governance vote allows IOTA token holders to decide on the proposed upgrade:

- **Announcement Phase:** The proposal is announced, and the community is informed.
- **Voting Open Phase (7 days):** Voters cast their ballots before counting begins.
- **Counting Phase (7 days):** Votes accumulate over time; each IOTA token accumulates voting power at a rate of 0.01 votes per milestone.
- **Quorum Requirement:** A minimum of 5% of the circulating supply must participate for the vote to be valid.
- **Outcome Determination:** The option with the majority of votes prevails.

## 15. What happens if the proposal is accepted?

If accepted:

- **Mainnet Upgrade:** The IOTA network will transition to the new IOTA Rebased protocol after thorough testing and audits.
- **Network Transition:** A final snapshot of the current network will migrate balances to the new network on a 1:1 basis.
- **IOTA EVM Chain Upgrade:** The IOTA EVM Layer 2 chain will be temporarily paused and upgraded to integrate with the new ledger.
- **Wallet Transition:** The IOTA Firefly wallet will be discontinued. Users can access their holdings with the new IOTA Wallet using the same private keys.
- **Token Continuity:** No token migration is necessary; tokens will be available immediately after the launch.

## 16. What happens if the proposal is rejected?

If rejected:

- **Current Operations Continue:** The IOTA network will continue operating as it currently does.
- **Future Decisions:** The IOTA Foundation will decide on future development paths and how to proceed with network improvements.

## 17. What is the IOTA Rebased proposal?

The IOTA Rebased proposal is a significant upgrade to the IOTA protocol that aims to enhance the network's capabilities by:

- **Transitioning to an Object-Based Architecture:** Moving away from the current UTXO model to an object-based ledger.
- **Introducing the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM):** Implementing MoveVM to enable Layer 1 (L1) smart contract capabilities.
- **Establishing Full Decentralization:** Adopting a delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) system with validators and stakers to secure the network.
- **Updating Tokenomics:** Introducing staking rewards, transaction fees, and a fee-burning mechanism to create a dynamic supply.

## 18. What is the future roadmap for IOTA?

The future roadmap includes:

- **Protocol Refinements:** Enhancements like resilient consensus mechanisms and fairer gas pricing.
- **Multi-VM Ledger:** Transitioning to support multiple virtual machines, including EVM, on Layer 1.
- **Tooling and Products:** Developing new wallets, SDKs, CLI tools, and identity solutions.
- **Mainnet Launch Timeline:** A potential launch in early 2025 after thorough testing and audits.

## 19. Why is IOTA making this change now?

The change addresses:

- **Market Demands:** There's a clear need for Layer 1 programmability and smart contracts to meet modern application requirements.
- **Technological Evolution:** The new architecture allows for faster, more secure, and scalable solutions.
- **Avoiding Delays:** Continuing with the current roadmap would require additional years of research and development with uncertain outcomes.
