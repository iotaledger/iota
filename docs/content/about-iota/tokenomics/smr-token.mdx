The SMR token, the native asset of the former Shimmer Network, has been migrated to IOTA Rebased as well; Making both IOTA and SMR available on the same network.

A total amount of **1,813,620,509** SMR tokens were minted as part of the initial token distribution, with no further supply increase or inflation. SMR Tokens are represented with 6 decimals, just like on the previous Shimmer network.

Unlike on the Shimmer network the SMR token can no longer be used to pay for fees, all fees are paid for in IOTA on the IOTA Rebased network. 

All original SMR Tokens are represented as a `0x2::smr::SMR` type of object on IOTA rebased, accessible on the same (Hex format) addresses from the Shimmer Network, accessible with the same keys from the Shimmer Network. No manual migration is needed to access these tokens.

The ShimmerEVM has also been migrated to the IOTA Network and remains active there.
