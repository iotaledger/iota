## IOTA Execution Architecture

The IOTA Execution Architecture, depicted in the included architectural diagram, outlines the technical approach for the iota execution crate to have a general view of component interaction. 
Here we have a visual representation of the iota_execution crate with its subcrates ([iota_adapter](adapter.mdx), [iota_move_natives](natives.mdx), iota_verifier).
