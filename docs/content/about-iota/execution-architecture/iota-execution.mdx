## IOTA Execution Architecture

The IOTA Execution Architecture, depicted in the included architectural diagram, outlines the technical approach for the iota execution crate to have a general view of component interaction. 
The following diagram is a visual representation of the iota_execution crate with its subcrates ([iota_adapter](adapter.mdx), [iota_move_natives](natives.mdx), iota_verifier).
The main purposes of iota execution are executing transactions (including PTBs), gas accounting, and supporting native functions.
