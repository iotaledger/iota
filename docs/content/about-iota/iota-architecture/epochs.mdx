# Epochs and Reconfiguration

## Epoch

In IOTA, an epoch is a set period, around 24 hours, during which the
IOTA [validator](../tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx) set and their stakes remain constant. This stable period allows
validators to handle transactions smoothly without unexpected changes.

Epoch values are part of the transaction data on the IOTA network, but regular users don't need to worry about them.
Users only need to know about epochs if they are dealing with
expiring [transactions](../../developer/iota-101/transactions/transactions.mdx), which must be completed before a
specific epoch ends.

## Reconfiguration

Reconfiguration is an important process that happens at the end of each epoch to prepare the network for the next one.
It includes these key steps:

### 1. Finalizing Transactions and Checkpoints

The network agrees on the final set of transactions and checkpoints for the current epoch, ensuring all validators have
the same information. This is the only time the network is fully synchronized, known as a _synchronous moment_, which is
essential for consistency.

### 2. Distribution of Gas Rewards

Computation gas fees are distributed to the validator staking reward pool, allowing stakers to withdraw their rewards.

### 3. Validator Set Change

Any pending staking and unstaking requests are finalized and reflected in the validators' stake distribution. Any
pending changes to the validator set, such as adding or removing validators, are processed. This is the only time the
validator set and stake distribution can be altered.

### 4. Protocol Upgrade

If 2f+1 validators agree, the network may upgrade to a new protocol version, which includes new features, bug fixes, and
updates to the Move framework libraries.
