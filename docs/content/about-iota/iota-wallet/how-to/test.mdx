## Get IOTA Tokens for Testing

When you first open the wallet, you have no coins in it. You can add test IOTA coins to your wallet for testing purposes. These tokens have no value and can only be used on the IOTA network you obtained them from, such as Devnet or Testnet.

### To Get IOTA Test Coins Using the Wallet

1. After installing the wallet extension, select one of the test networks, either Devnet or Testnet.
2. If your wallet has no coins, a button will display to request tokens.
3. Click `Request Devnet IOTA tokens` or `Request Testnet IOTA tokens`, depending on the network you chose.
4. Once you have coins in your wallet, the button moves to the `Settings` page. To access it, click the cog icon in the top-right corner of the wallet interface.

:::note Limits

You can request IOTA coins only once every 60 minutes.
After clicking the button, IOTA test tokens will appear in your wallet under the `Coins` tab.
