# Stake IOTA

Stake your IOTA tokens to earn rewards while helping secure the network.
By staking, you delegate your IOTA to a validator, who will compensate you for your support.

## Access the Staking Feature

To start staking your IOTA tokens, follow these steps:

1. Open your IOTA Wallet and navigate to the `Home` tab.

## Withdraw Your Staked IOTA

Withdraw your staked IOTA whenever you wish, whether to re-stake with another validator or use your tokens elsewhere.
Once you request a withdrawal, your staking rewards will stop,
and any earned rewards will be distributed at the end of the current epoch.

1. Go to the `Home` tab and select `Current Stake`.
