# Use IOTA Wallet for Testing

You can use IOTA Wallet with various IOTA networks to test new or updated apps on IOTA. Besides the IOTA Mainnet, IOTA Wallet supports connecting to IOTA Testnet, IOTA Devnet, a Local network, or a Custom RPC URL on a network you create.

To learn how to create a local network, see [Create a Local IOTA Network](#).

## Change the Active Network Connection

1. Click the menu (three bars) at the top-right corner of the IOTA Wallet interface.
2. Click **Network**.
3. Click the network you want to use. A checkmark displays next to the active network.

## Get IOTA Tokens for Testing

When you first open the wallet, you have no coins in it. You can add test IOTA coins to your wallet for testing purposes. These tokens have no value and can only be used on the IOTA network you obtained them from, such as Devnet or Testnet.

### To Get IOTA Test Coins Using the Wallet

1. After installing the wallet extension, select one of the test networks, either Devnet or Testnet.
2. If your wallet has no coins, a button will display to request tokens.
3. Click **Request Devnet IOTA tokens** or **Request Testnet IOTA tokens**, depending on the network you chose.
4. Once you have coins in your wallet, the button moves to the **Settings** page. To access it, click the three bars in the top-right corner of the wallet interface.

> **Note:** You can request IOTA coins only once every 60 minutes. After clicking the button, IOTA test tokens will appear in your wallet under the **Coins** tab.

### To Get IOTA Test Coins Through Discord

1. Click **Coins** in the wallet.
2. Click the small clipboard icon next to your address to copy it. The address, which starts with `0x`, is near the top of the wallet.
3. Go to the Discord faucet channel for the network you're using:
    - [Devnet Faucet](#) channel on Discord.
    - [Testnet Faucet](#) (This channel may not always be available).
4. Use the `!faucet` command with your wallet address to request tokens:

```
!faucet 0x6c04ed5110554acf59ff1b535129548dd9a0c741
```
   Replace the address in the command with your own wallet address.
5. The channel bot will confirm your request with a message.
