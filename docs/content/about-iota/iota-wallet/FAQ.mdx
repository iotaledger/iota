# IOTA Wallet FAQ

## How to Get IOTA Wallet

IOTA Wallet, your comprehensive tool for managing digital assets on the IOTA network, is accessible through a browser extension.

### For Browser Extension:
Install the IOTA Wallet extension from the [Google Chrome Web Store](#). It works across all Chromium-based browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Brave.


## Can I use IOTA Wallet on browsers not based on Chromium?
Currently, IOTA Wallet is optimized for Chromium-based browsers, and there are no immediate plans to expand support to other browser types.

## What is a mnemonic recovery phrase?
A mnemonic recovery phrase is a unique 24-word text string provided when you create a wallet on IOTA. It's crucial for wallet recovery and transferring your wallet account to another device. Keep it safe and secure.

## What does it mean to import an existing wallet?
You can import a wallet account from another wallet if you have the mnemonic recovery phrase for that wallet. It is not possible to import a wallet without the mnemonic recovery phrase.

## How do I get IOTA into my wallet?
You can receive IOTA from another address, through exchanges, or directly within the IOTA Wallet using a credit card. Partners like Coinbase, MoonPay, and Transak facilitate these purchases within the wallet.

## My NFTs are in my wallet, but I can't see the images. Why?
IOTA Wallet uses the Object Display standard for showing NFT images. If an NFT does not adhere to this standard, the wallet will display the asset without its image.

## How do I send IOTA to another person?
To send IOTA, you need the recipient's wallet address. Ensure you double-check the address because completed transactions can't be reversed, and IOTA cannot be recovered if sent to an incorrect address.

## Failed Transactions and Gas Fees

### Why do I still pay gas fees when my transactions fail?
Transactions can fail due to issues like incorrect specifications or insufficient gas budgets, but gas fees are still required to compensate validators for processing the transaction attempt.

### Why did I pay a negative gas fee on a failed transaction?
Sometimes, failed transactions may delete gas objects, resulting in storage rebates that exceed the gas fee, effectively giving you a positive IOTA transfer despite the failure.

## What is staking?
Staking allows you to earn rewards by placing your IOTA with validators on the network who verify transactions. Each validator offers different rewards. The minimum staking amount is 1 IOTA.

## How do I track my stake?
You can view your stakes on the **Home** tab of IOTA Wallet, including the average APY earned from all the validators you staked with.

## Can I set up alerts for my stake?
IOTA Wallet does not support alerts at this time. Stakes are rewarded at the end of each 24-hour epoch, and you can withdraw your stake anytime.

## What does Active Connections mean?
Active Connections displays any apps currently connected to your IOTA Wallet. Connections persist until removed, even without transactions. You can disconnect from apps by selecting them in the **Active Connections** tab.

## Where can I see more detail about my transactions and activity?
The **Activity** tab on IOTA Wallet shows a list of all transactions. Click on a transaction to view its details.

## My wallet keeps logging me out. How do I stop this?
IOTA Wallet automatically logs out after a period of inactivity for security. You can adjust the auto-lock timeout to a maximum of 30 minutes in the wallet settings.

## Network and Version Updates
Ensure you're connected to the correct network for your activities. Network resets, like on Devnet, may temporarily affect asset visibility.

## I think someone has access to my IOTA Wallet. What should I do?
Immediately transfer your assets to another wallet if you believe someone has unauthorized access. Also, check for malware, verify your mnemonic recovery phrase is secure, and review activity on a IOTA transaction explorer.

## Can I update my mnemonic recovery phrase to something more memorable?
No, the passphrase generated by IOTA Wallet cannot be changed. Always keep your mnemonic recovery phrase secure.
