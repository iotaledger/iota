# IOTA Wallet FAQ

## How Do I Get IOTA Wallet?

You can install the IOTA Wallet extension from the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/iota-wallet-rc/nlmllpflpelpannpijhhnbhekpbpejch).
It works across all Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Brave.

## Can I Use IOTA Wallet on Non-Chromium Browsers?

Currently, IOTA Wallet is designed for Chromium-based browsers.
There are no plans to expand support to other browser types at this time.

## What Is a Mnemonic Recovery Phrase?

A mnemonic recovery phrase is a unique 24-word string that IOTA provides when you create a wallet.
It is essential for recovering your wallet and transferring it to another device.
Keep it secure at all times.

## What Does It Mean to Import an Existing Wallet?

[Importing](how-to/multi-account.mdx#import-a-profile) a wallet means bringing an account from another wallet into IOTA Wallet using its mnemonic recovery phrase,
private key or seed.

## How Do I Get IOTA Into My Wallet?

You can receive IOTA from another address or acquire it from an exchange.

## My NFTs Are in My Wallet, but I Can’t See the Images. Why?

IOTA Wallet uses the Object Display standard for showing NFT images.
If an NFT does not follow this standard, the wallet will display the asset without an image.

## How Do I Send IOTA to Another Person?

To send IOTA, you need the recipient’s wallet address.
Always double-check the address, as IOTA cannot be recovered if sent to the wrong address,
and transactions cannot be reversed.

## Failed Transactions and Gas Fees

### Why Do I Still Pay Gas Fees When My Transaction Fails?

Transactions may fail due to incorrect specifications or an insufficient gas budget, but gas fees are still required as
compensation for validators processing the attempt.

### Why Did I Receive a Negative Gas Fee on a Failed Transaction?

In some cases, a failed transaction may delete gas objects, resulting in storage rebates that exceed the gas fee,
leading to a positive IOTA transfer despite the failure.

## What Is Staking?

Staking allows you to earn rewards by delegating your IOTA to validators who help secure the network.
Each validator offers different reward rates.
The minimum amount required to stake is 1 IOTA.

## How Do I Track My Stake?

You can monitor your [stakes](how-to/stake.mdx#view-your-current-stakes) on the `Home` tab of the IOTA Wallet.
This includes viewing the average APY earned from validators you are staked with.

## Can I Set Up Alerts for My Stake?

At this time, IOTA Wallet does not support alerts.
Rewards are distributed at the end of each 24-hour epoch, and you can withdraw your stake at any time.

## What Does Active Connections Mean?

Active Connections shows the apps currently linked to your IOTA Wallet.
These connections remain active until manually removed, even if no transactions are made.
To disconnect, go to the `Active Connections` tab and select the app.

## Where Can I Find Detailed Information About My Transactions?

In the `Activity` tab of IOTA Wallet, you’ll find a list of all your transactions.
Click on any transaction to view more details.

## My Wallet Keeps Logging Me Out. How Do I Stop This?

For security reasons, IOTA Wallet logs you out after a period of inactivity.
You can increase the auto-lock timeout to a maximum of 30 minutes by [adjusting your wallet settings](how-to/basics.mdx#enable-auto-lock-for-your-iota-wallet).

## Network and Version Updates

Make sure you're connected to the correct network for your activities.
Events like network resets on Devnet may temporarily affect the visibility of your assets.

## I Think Someone Has Access to My IOTA Wallet. What Should I Do?

If you suspect unauthorized access to your wallet, immediately transfer your assets to a new wallet.
Check for malware, ensure your mnemonic recovery phrase is secure,
and review recent activity using an IOTA transaction explorer.

## Can I Update My Mnemonic Recovery Phrase to Something More Memorable?

No, the mnemonic recovery phrase provided by IOTA Wallet cannot be changed.
Always store it securely, as it is essential for wallet recovery.
