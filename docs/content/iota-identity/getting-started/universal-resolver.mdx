# Universal Resolver for IOTA DIDs

The IOTA Identity framework includes a Universal Resolver driver that supports the `did:iota` method. This driver is part of the [Universal Resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/) infrastructure, which provides a unified interface for resolving DIDs across different methods.

## Example DIDs

You can resolve IOTA DIDs like this example:
```
did:iota:0xf4d6f08f5a1b80dd578da7dc1b49c886d580acd4cf7d48119dfeb82b538ad88a
```

## Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to get started is using our Docker image:

```bash
# Pull and run the Docker image
docker run -p 8080:8080 iotaledger/uni-resolver-driver-iota
```

Once running, you can resolve DIDs using a simple HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:8080/1.0/identifiers/<did>
```

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source using Rust:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Network Configuration

The resolver supports three network types:
- Testnet
- Devnet
- Custom networks

:::note
Mainnet support is coming soon.
:::

### Environment Variables

Configure the network using these environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NETWORK` | Yes | Network type: `"testnet"`, `"devnet"`, or `"custom"` |
| `IOTA_CUSTOM_NODE_ENDPOINT` | Only for custom network | The URL of your custom node |
| `IOTA_CUSTOM_IDENTITY_PKG_ID` | Only for custom network | The identity package ID for your custom network |

### Configuration Examples

#### Single Network
```bash
NETWORK=testnet
```

#### Multiple Networks
```bash
NETWORK=testnet,devnet
```

#### Custom Network
```bash
NETWORK=custom
IOTA_CUSTOM_NODE_ENDPOINT=https://your-custom-node-endpoint.com
IOTA_CUSTOM_IDENTITY_PKG_ID=0x4bbd377239914fced5c1207a28443064050e880a1234858904e0ce31a5a9768c
```
