# Challenge 6: Go Recycle!

The City of Venice is tired of all the trash ending up in the canals, especially pizza boxes still filled with a certain type of pizza which are just dumped everywhere are ruining the experience. They decided to start a recycling program rewarding people who do their part with a Venetian Flag; Go grab one! 

For this challenge you might want to investigate the [Transfer to object](../iota-101/objects/transfers/transfer-to-object.mdx) functionality; Pizzaboxes from previous challenges can not be used in this one.
