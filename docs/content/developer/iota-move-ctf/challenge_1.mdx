# Challenge 1: Checkin

In this first challenge, your task is to interact with a basic Move contract. The contract defines a `Flag` object, which you need to retrieve by calling a specific function.

The contract mints a new flag and transfers it to your account. Your goal is to [call the function](../getting-started/publish.mdx#accessing-your-package), capture the flag, and then submit the object ID to verify your success.

This challenge is designed to be an easy introduction, guiding you through the process of interacting with the blockchain, calling functions, and understanding the basics of flag capture.
