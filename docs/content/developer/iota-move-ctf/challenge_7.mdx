# Challenge 7: PTBs

In response to the recent pizza challenge, the city of Venice has implemented a smart contract to efficiently manage ingredients and prevent hoarding. Participants are invited to utilize these perishable ingredients, which must be used immediately to create dough. 

Your objective is to gather the necessary ingredients—flour, water, yeast, and salt—and craft the dough required to capture the flag. This challenge can be solved using the Move CLI and the [`iota client ptb` command.](../../references/cli/ptb.mdx)
