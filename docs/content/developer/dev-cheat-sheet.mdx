## Move

|**Topic**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|**General**| <ul><li>  Upgrading a package (`P` to `P'`) doesn't auto-update dependencies; update dependent packages and clients explicitly. </li> <li> Public function signatures can't be deleted/changed; use `public(package)` or `private` visibility unless exposing permanent library functions.  </li> <li> It is not possible to delete `struct` types, add new fields (though you can add dynamic fields), or add new [abilities](https://move-language.github.io/move/abilities.html) via an upgrade. Introduce new types carefully—they will live forever! </li> <li> Use `vector`-backed collections (`vector`, `VecSet`, `VecMap`, `PriorityQueue`) with a **known** maximum size of ≤ 1000 items. </li> <li> Use dynamic field-backed collections (`Table`, `Bag`, `ObjectBag`, `ObjectTable`, `LinkedTable`) for any collection that allows third-party addition, larger collections, and collections of unknown size. </li> <li> Move objects have a maximum size of 250KB—any attempt to create a larger object leads to an aborted transaction. Ensure that your objects do not have an ever-growing `vector`-backed collection. </li> <li> If your function `f` needs a payment in (e.g.) IOTA from the caller, use `fun f(payment: Coin<IOTA>)` not `fun f(payment: &mut Coin<IOTA>, amount: u64)`. This is safer for callers—they know exactly how much they are paying, and do not need to trust `f` to extract the right amount. </li> <li> Don't micro-optimize gas usage. IOTA computation costs are rounded up to the closest _bucket_, so only very drastic changes will make a difference. In particular, if your transaction is already in the lowest cost bucket, it can't get any cheaper. </li> <li> Follow the [Move coding conventions](https://move-language.github.io/move/coding-conventions.html) for consistent style.</li></ul> |
|**Composability**| <ul><li> Use the `display` standard to customize how your objects show up in wallets, apps, and explorers </li><li> Avoid "self-transfers"—whenever possible, instead of writing `transfer::transfer(obj, tx_context::sender(ctx))`, return `obj` from the current function. This allows a caller or programmable transaction block to use `obj`. </li></ul> |

## Apps

| **Topic** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| **Optimal performance** | For optimal performance and data consistency, apps should use the wallet's [`signTransactionBlock`](../references/ts-sdk/dapp-kit/index.mdx) API to sign transactions and then submit them via [`execute_transactionBlock`](/iota-api-ref#iota_executetransactionblock) on the app's full node. This ensures immediate read-after-write consistency, as the app's full node reflects writes instantly, avoiding delays from checkpointing. |
| **Lower latency** | For lower latency, use [`executeTransactionBlock`](/iota-api-ref#iota_executetransactionblock) with `"showEffects": false` and `"showEvents": false` if your app only needs confirmation of a transaction without immediate access to its effects or events.|
| **Local cache** | Apps should implement a local cache for frequently read data rather than over-fetching from the full node. |
| **Transaction cache**| Whenever possible,use programmable transaction blocks to compose on-chain functionality instead of deploying new contracts, enabling batching and lowering gas fees. |
|**Wallet dependency**| Apps should leave gas budget, gas price, and coin selection to the wallet. This gives wallets more flexibility, and it's the wallet's responsibility to dry run a transaction to ensure it doesn't fail. |

## Signing

| **Topic** | **Description** |
|-|-|
|**Concurrent Transactions**| Avoid signing concurrent transactions involving the same owned object. Use independent objects or wait for one transaction to finish to prevent client [equivocation](/references/iota-glossary.mdx#equivocation), which can lock the objects until the epoch ends. |
|**CLI transaction**| Use the `--serialize-output` flag with any iota client command (e.g., `publish`, `call`) to generate a base64 transaction for signing. |
|**Transaction Signing**| IOTA supports several signature schemes for transaction signing, including native multisig.|
