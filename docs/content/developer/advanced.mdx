Information in the Advanced Topics section covers coding practices, useful features, and other developer-focused considerations that might arise as you continue your development journey on IOTA. The topics in this section aren't necessarily more difficult than other topics, but they include subjects you might not encounter or need to consider until you're developing more advanced solutions on the IOTA network.

## Asset Tokenization

Asset tokenization refers to the process of representing real-world assets, such as real estate, art, commodities, stocks, or other valuable assets, as digital tokens on the blockchain network. This involves converting the ownership or rights of an asset into digital tokens, which are then recorded and managed on the blockchain.
