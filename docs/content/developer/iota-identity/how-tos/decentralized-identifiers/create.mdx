If you want to benefit from Self-Sovereign Identity,
you need to create a [Decentralized Identity](../../explanations/decentralized-identifiers.mdx).
This identity consists of many parts that have different functions.

:::note DID method Specification

Note that the Iota Identity Framework follows [IOTA DID Method Specification](../../../../references/iota-identity/iota-did-method-spec.mdx).

## Identity Generation Process

### 1. Get Funds to cover the gas costs

The first thing you will need to generate an identity is an address with enough funds to cover
the gas cost of the whole procedure.
In test networks as well as local ones, you can use a faucet to request funds.

:::tip

If you want to use the main IOTA network,
you will need an an address with actual IOTA funds to create a new Identity.

```

### 2. Create the content for the DID Document

As a bare minimum, a [DID document](../../explanations/decentralized-identifiers.mdx) needs at least one verification method.

At this point, the DID itself is unknown since the `Identity` object is not published yet and thus there's no `ID` for it.

:::tip

You can use a placeholder `did:iota:0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` to reference
the DID inside the document.

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>

### 3. Construct an `Identity` Object

Next, you need to construct a new [Identity Object](../../explanations/about-identity-objects.mdx) that contains the just created
DID Document.
The created `Identity` contains an encoded version of the DID Document, and has a single controller that is represented by a newly
created `ControllerCap`.

:::info Controller Capability
When a new `Identity` is created the transaction's sender is assumed to be its controller and thus a `ControllerCap` is sent to its address.

## Running Examples Locally

In order to run the examples, you will need to run an IOTA network locally.

If you want to use something different, you will need to modify the API and faucet endpoints in the examples to match your
setup.
