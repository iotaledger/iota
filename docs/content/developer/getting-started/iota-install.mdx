import MacosDeps from "../../_snippets/macos-deps.mdx";
import LinuxDeps from "../../_snippets/linux-deps.mdx";

The simplest way to get up and running with IOTA it to [install the binary](#install-from-binaries) from the latest
release available in the [IOTA Rebased GitHub Repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/). Make sure to download
the version that matches the network you want to work on.

You can also use the
convenient [docker images in the repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/docker) to run your own
local network.

If you are require full control over the installation sources and process, you can
always [build the binaries yourself from source](#install-from-source).

## Supported operating systems

IOTA supports the following operating systems:

- Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 (Bionic Beaver)
- macOS - macOS Monterey
- Microsoft Windows - Windows 10 and 11

## Install Using a Package Manager

You can use the following commands to let a package manager handle the installation process. You can
use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux
or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem label="Homebrew" value="mac">

```bash
brew install iota
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Chocolatey" value="win">

```shell
choco install iota
```

Find more [versions of IOTA for Windows](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/iota) on the Chocolatey community
website. TODO Check Link availability

## Install From Binaries

You can find a set of binaries for most operating systems with
each [IOTA release](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/releases) that you can use to install IOTA. We recommend that you
use the latest stable release for the network you are working on.

Once you have downloaded and extracted the `.tgz` file that matches your operating system, you should open the folder
and
install the necessary binaries. You should start with the main IOTA binary.

1. iota-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Main IOTA binary.
2. iota-faucet-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Local faucet to mint coins on local network.
3. iota-indexer-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: An indexer for a local IOTA network.
4. iota-node-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Run a local node.
5. iota-test-validator-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Run test validators on a local network for development.
6. iota-tool-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Provides utilities for IOTA.

:::note

This process may take several minutes to download and install, this depends on your network and PC specifications.

:::

### Test

You can quickly test if you have successfully installed the binaries by running the following command:

```bash
iota
```

It should output a message stating the currently installed IOTA version, as well as some helpful commands.

## Install From Source

You can use this section to install the Rust crates (packages) to interact with IOTA networks, including the IOTA CLI,
from source.

:::tip

You can also download the [source code](./iota-environment.mdx) to have local access to files.

:::

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you install the following before you attempt to install IOTA from source.

### Rust and Cargo

#### Install

IOTA is built on Rust and, like most Rust projects, uses Cargo as a package manager. You can find detailed instructions
on how to install Rust and Cargo for your OS in
the [official Rust Documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

You can use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Update

Since IOTA uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies, you may need
to [update](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). The recommended update method is using `rustup`, as shown bellow:

```bash
rustup update stable
```

### Additional Prerequisites by Operating System

Select the appropriate tab to view the requirements for your system.

:::info

The Linux instructions assume a distribution that uses the APT package manager. You might need to adjust the
instructions to use other package managers.

:::

Install the prerequisites listed in this section. Use the following command to update `apt-get`:

#### Additional tools for Windows

IOTA requires the following additional tools on computers running Windows.

- For Windows on ARM64 only - [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).
- [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) is required to [install Rust](#rust-and-cargo).
- The [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure](https://releases.llvm.org/). Look for a file with a name similar to
  LLVM-15.0.7-win64.exe for 64-bit Windows, or LLVM-15.0.7-win32.exe for 32-bit Windows.

**Known issue** - The `iota console` command does not work in PowerShell.

## Install IOTA Binaries From Source

Run the following command to install IOTA binaries from the `testnet` branch:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git --branch testnet iota
```

The installation process can take a while to complete. You can monitor installation progress in the terminal. If you
encounter an error, make sure to install the latest version of all prerequisites and then try the command again.

To update to the latest stable version of Rust:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

The command installs IOTA components in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

## Upgrade IOTA Binaries

If you previously installed the IOTA binaries, you can update them to the most recent release with the same command you
used to install them:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git --branch testnet iota
```
