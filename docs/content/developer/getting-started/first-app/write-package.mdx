title: Write a Move Package
description: The first step in getting a package on chain is to write the Move code that defines the logic of your package. The structure of a Move package is similar to those in Rust.
---

To begin, open a terminal or console at the location you plan to store your package. Use the `iota move new` command to create an empty Move package with the name `my_first_package`:

```shell
$ iota move new my_first_package
```

Running the previous command creates a directory with the name you provide (`my_first_package` in this case). The command populates the new directory with a skeleton Move project that consists of a `sources` directory and a `Move.toml` manifest file. Open the manifest with a text editor to review its contents:

```move title="my_first_package/Move.toml"
[package]
name = "my_first_package"
edition = "2024.beta" # edition = "legacy" to use legacy (pre-2024) Move
# license = ""           # e.g., "MIT", "GPL", "Apache 2.0"
# authors = ["..."]      # e.g., ["Joe Smith (joesmith@noemail.com)", "John Snow (johnsnow@noemail.com)"]

[dependencies]
Iota = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git", subdir = "crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }

# For remote import, use the `{ git = "...", subdir = "...", rev = "..." }`.
# Revision can be a branch, a tag, and a commit hash.
# MyRemotePackage = { git = "https://some.remote/host.git", subdir = "remote/path", rev = "main" }

# For local dependencies use `local = path`. Path is relative to the package root
# Local = { local = "../path/to" }

# To resolve a version conflict and force a specific version for dependency
# override use `override = true`
# Override = { local = "../conflicting/version", override = true }

[addresses]
my_first_package = "0x0"

# Named addresses will be accessible in Move as `@name`. They're also exported:
# for example, `std = "0x1"` is exported by the Standard Library.
# alice = "0xA11CE"

[dev-dependencies]
# The dev-dependencies section allows overriding dependencies for `--test` and
# `--dev` modes. You can introduce test-only dependencies here.
# Local = { local = "../path/to/dev-build" }

[dev-addresses]
# The dev-addresses section allows overwriting named addresses for the `--test`
# and `--dev` modes.
# alice = "0xB0B"
```

The manifest file contents include available sections of the manifest and comments that provide additional information. In Move, you prepend the hash mark (`#`) to a line to denote a comment.

- **[package]:** Contains metadata for the package. By default, the `iota move new` command populates only the `name` value of the metadata. In this case, the example passes `my_first_package` to the command, which becomes the name of the package. You can delete the first `#` of subsequent lines of the `[package]` section to provide values for the other available metadata fields. 
- **[dependencies]:** Lists the other packages that your package depends on to run. By default, the `iota move new` command lists the `Iota` package on GitHub (Testnet version) as the lone dependency.  
- **[addresses]:** Declares named addresses that your package uses. By default, the section includes the package you create with the `iota move new` command and an address of `0x0`. The publish process replaces the `0x0` address with an actual on-chain address.
- **[dev-dependencies]:** Includes only comments that describe the section.
- **[dev-addresses]:** Includes only comments that describe the section.

:::info Local IOTA Framework

When developing locally you might want to use your local repository version of the IOTA Framework instead of the one coming from Github. In order to do this replace:

```
Iota = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git", subdir = "crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }
```

with 

```
Iota = { local = "/PATH/TO_YOUR_REPO/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework"}
```

:::

### Defining the package

You have a package now but it doesn't do anything. To make your package useful, you must add logic contained in `.move` source files that define *modules*. Use a text editor or the command line to create your first package source file named `my_module.move` in the `sources` directory of the package:

``` shell
$ touch my_first_package/sources/my_module.move
```

Populate the `my_module.move` file with the following code:

```move
module my_first_package::my_module {

    // Part 1: Struct definitions.
    public struct Sword has key, store {
        id: UID,
        magic: u64,
        strength: u64,
    }

    public struct Forge has key, store {
        id: UID,
        swords_created: u64,
    }

    // Part 2: Module initializer to be executed when this module is published.
    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let admin = Forge {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            swords_created: 0,
        };
        // Transfer the forge object to the module/package publisher.
        transfer::public_transfer(admin, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }

    // Part 3: Accessors required to read the struct attributes.
    public fun magic(self: &Sword): u64 {
        self.magic
    }

    public fun strength(self: &Sword): u64 {
        self.strength
    }

    public fun swords_created(self: &Forge): u64 {
        self.swords_created
    }

    // Part 4: Public/entry functions (introduced later in the tutorial).

    // Part 5: Private functions (if any).
}
```

:::info Imports

By default the most common IOTA Framework packages and structs are imported. This allows you to use for example `UID` and `TxContext` in this example without needing to import it.

:::

The comments in the preceding code highlight different parts of a typical Move source file.

- **Part 1: Struct declarations** - Structs define types that a module can create or destroy. Struct definitions can include abilities provided with the `has` keyword. The structs in this example, for instance, have the `key` ability, which indicates that these structs are IOTA objects that you can transfer between addresses. The `store` ability on the structs provides the ability to appear in other struct fields and be transferred freely.

- **Part 2: Module initializer** - A special function that is invoked exactly once when the module publishes.

- **Part 3: Accessor functions** - These functions allow the fields of the module's structs to be read from other modules.

After you save the file, you have a complete Move package.
