# Get Test Tokens

You can use the IOTA faucet to get free test IOTAs to pay for [gas](../../about-iota/tokenomics/gas-in-iota.mdx) on the IOTA Devnet and Testnet networks. These test tokens have no real-world value.

## Using the IOTA CLI

You can use the [IOTA CLI client](../../references/cli/client.mdx) to request tokens for your [address](get-address.mdx) by using the `iota client faucet` command. By default, the command will use the active network and address, but you can specify any values for these using the following parameters:

- `--address` argument to provide a specific address (or its alias),
- `--url` argument to provide a custom faucet endpoint.

## Request test tokens through Discord

1. Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/iota).
   If you try to join the IOTA Discord channel using a newly created Discord account, you may need to wait a few days for validation.
1. Request test IOTA tokens in the IOTA [#devnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) or [#testnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) Discord channels. Send the following message to the channel with your client address:
   `!faucet <Your client address>`

## Request test tokens through wallet

You can request test tokens within IOTA Wallet.

## Using cURL

You can use the following cURL command to request tokens directly from the faucet server:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://faucet.devnet.iota.io/gas' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<YOUR IOTA ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```

:::tip Test tokens on a local network

If you're working with a local network, replace `'https://faucet.devnet.iota.io/gas'` with the appropriate value based on which package runs your network:

- `iota-faucet`: `http://127.0.0.1:5003/gas`
- `iota-test-validator`: `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas`

You can also get tokens from your [local faucet](local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet).

:::

## Using the TypeScript SDK

You can also access the faucet using the IOTA TypeScript-SDK, as shown in the example below:

```typescript
import { requestIOTAFromFaucetV0, getFaucetHost } from '@iota/iota.js/faucet';

// get tokens from the Devnet faucet server
await requestIOTAFromFaucetV0({
  // connect to Devnet
	host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
	recipient: '<YOUR IOTA ADDRESS>',
});
```
