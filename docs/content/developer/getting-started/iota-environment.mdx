# Before You Start

It's a good idea to look at the toolbox before you start building. This section will give you a quick overview
of:

* The content in the [IOTA repository](#the-iota-repository).
* The IOTA [branch and network structure](#branch-and-network-structure).
* How you can interact with IOTA Nodes using the [CLI](#iota-cli) or the [available SDKs](#iota-sdks).
* IDEs and plugins.

## The IOTA Repository

You can find all the official crates and tools offered by IOTA in
the [IOTA monorepo](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/).
It contains all the source code used to build on and run the IOTA network. The following section will give a brief
overview of the most important folders:

- [apps](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/apps) Contains the source code for the main web applications
  that
  IOTA runs, for example, the `IOTA Wallet`.
- [crates](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates): Contains all the Rust crates that are part of the
  IOTA
  system.
- [dapps](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/dapps): Contains some examples of decentralized applications
  built on top of IOTA, such as Kiosk or Sponsored Transactions.
- [dashboards](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/dashboards): Currently empty.
- [doc](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/doc): Contains deprecated documentation related to Move and
  IOTA.
- [docker](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/docker): Contains the docker files needed to spin up a node,
  an
  indexer, a Full node, or other services.
- [docs](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/docs): Contains this documentation and the source for this
  site.
- [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/examples): Contains examples of apps written for IOTA and
  smart contracts written in Move.
- [external-crates](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/external-crates): Contains the source code for the
  Move
  programming language.
- [kiosk](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/kiosk): Contains the source code of the `IOTA Kiosk`
  extensions and rules, as well as examples.
- [narwhal](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/narwhal): Contains the source code of Narwhal and partially
  synchronous Bullshark, a DAG-based mempool, and efficient BFT consensus.
- [nre](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/nre): Contains information about node and network reliability
  engineering.
- [scripts](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/scripts): Contains a number of scripts that are used
  internally.
- [sdk](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/sdk): Contains the source code for different tools and SDKs,
  such
  as the IOTA TypeScript SDK, Kiosk SDK, BCS, dApp kit, etc.
- [iota-execution](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/iota-execution): Contains the source code responsible
  for abstracting access to the execution layer.

The following primary directories offer a good starting point for exploring the IOTA codebase:

- [move](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/external-crates/move) - Move VM, compiler, and tools.
- [narwhal](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/narwhal) - Mempool and consensus.
- [typescript-sdk](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/sdk/typescript/) - the IOTA TypeScript SDK.
- [wallet](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/apps/wallet) - Chrome extension wallet for IOTA.
- [iota](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota) - the IOTA command line tool.
- [iota-core](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-core) - Core IOTA components.
- [iota-execution](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/iota-execution) - Execution Layer (programmable
  transactions, execution integration).
- [iota-framework](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-framework) - Move system packages (0x1,
  0x2,
  0x3, 0xdee9).
- [iota-network](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-network) - Networking interfaces.
- [iota-node](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-node) - Validator and Full node software.
- [iota-protocol-config](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-protocol-config) - On-chain system
  configuration and limits.
- [iota-sdk](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-sdk) - The IOTA Rust SDK.
- [iota-types](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-types) - IOTA object types, such as coins and
  gas.

## Branch and Network Structure

The main branches in the IOTA repository correspond to its
networks ([`devnet`](#devnet), [`testnet`](#testnet), [`mainnet`](#mainnet)) plus a `develop` branch with the most
recent changes.

### Devnet

The `devnet` branch is the latest stable build of IOTA. Choose the `devnet` branch if you want to build or test on
IOTA Devnet. If you encounter an issue or find a bug, it may already be fixed in the [`develop`](#develop) branch. To
submit a PR, you should push commits to your fork of the [`develop`](#develop) branch.

### Testnet

The `testnet` branch includes the code running on the IOTA Testnet network.

### Mainnet

The `mainnet` branch includes the code running on the IOTA Mainnet network.

### Develop

The `develop` branch includes the most recent changes and updates. Use the `develop` branch if you want to contribute to
the
IOTA project or to experiment with cutting-edge functionality. The `develop` branch might include unreleased changes and
experimental features, so use it at your own risk.

## Interact with IOTA

### IOTA CLI

The [IOTA CLI](../../references/cli.mdx) provides a handy interface you can use to perform all sorts of operation with
IOTA nodes.

### IOTA SDKs

IOTA provides two official SDKs that you can use to interact with the IOTA network from your dApp:

* [Typescript SDK](../../references/ts-sdk/typescript/index.mdx)
* [Rust SDK](../../references/rust-sdk.mdx)

## Move IDEs and plugins

We recommend that you use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE with the `move-analyzer`
extension. Follow the Visual Studio Marketplace instructions to install the move-analyzer extension, and then install
the `move-analyzer` language server
passing `address32` using the `--features` flag and passing `iota-move` to the branch flag:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --branch iota-move --features "address32"
```

After you install VS Code and the `move-analyzer` extension, check out
the [Move code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/examples/move).

You can use the `iota move` from the IOTA CLI command to test or run a Move example on IOTA.
