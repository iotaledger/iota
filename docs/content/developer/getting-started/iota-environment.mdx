# Before You Start

It's a good idea to look at the toolbox before you start building. This section will give you a quick overview
of the most important tools to get started:

* How you can interact with IOTA Nodes using the [CLI](#iota-cli) or the [available SDKs](#iota-sdks).
* IDEs and plugins.

## Interact with IOTA

### IOTA CLI

The [IOTA CLI](../../references/cli.mdx) provides a handy interface you can use to perform all sorts of operation with
IOTA nodes.

### IOTA SDKs

IOTA provides two official SDKs that you can use to interact with the IOTA network from your dApp:

* [Typescript SDK](../../references/ts-sdk/typescript/index.mdx)
* [Rust SDK](../../references/rust-sdk.mdx)

## Move IDEs and plugins

We recommend that you use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE with the `move-analyzer`
extension. Follow the Visual Studio Marketplace instructions to install the move-analyzer extension, and then install
the `move-analyzer` language server
passing `address32` using the `--features` flag and passing `iota-move` to the branch flag:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --branch iota-move --features "address32"
```

After you install VS Code and the `move-analyzer` extension, check out
the [Move code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/examples/move).

You can use the `iota move` from the IOTA CLI command to test or run a Move example on IOTA.
