# Local Development

You can create a local IOTA network to develop and test your dApps with the latest changes in the IOTA repository. You
can set it up using the `iota` binary with the `iota start` subcommand, which can start a local IOTA network
consisting of 4 IOTA validators with indexer and a test token faucet.

## Prerequisites

You should [install the IOTA CLI tool](install-iota.mdx) to interact with the local node.

## Start a Local Network

You can start a local network by running the following command from your `iota` root folder.

```bash
RUST_LOG="off,iota_node=info" cargo run --bin iota start --force-regenesis --with-faucet
```

The command will start a local network with a test token faucet. The `RUST_LOG`=`off,iota_node=info` turns off logging for all
components except iota-node. If you want to see more detailed logs, you can remove `RUST_LOG` from the command.

:::danger No persistence

Data on the local network does not persist when the `--force-regenesis` flag is
used.

To persist data use the `--config-dir` flag instead.

:::

## Customize a Local Network

You can add the following additional parameters to the [start command](#start-a-local-network) to customize your
network:

* `--epoch-duration-ms <EPOCH_DURATION_MS>`:  Change epoch duration from the default one minute to your desired value.
* `--with-faucet=<FAUCET_PORT>`: Change the port where the IOTA faucet starts.
* `--fullnode-rpc-port <FULLNODE_RPC_PORT>`: Change the port where the Full-node RPC server starts.

:::tip Validator Help

Use `iota start --help` to see these options in your console.

:::

## Interact With Your Local Node

### Using cURL

You can use cURL to send JSON requests to your local node. The following example will retrieve the total transaction
count from your local network:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9000' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "iota_getTotalTransactionBlocks",
  "params": []
}'
```

If successful, the response resembles the following:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 168,
  "id": 1
}
```

### Using the IOTA Client CLI

#### Create a local env

The IOTA Client CLI is compatible with all IOTA networks. You only need to specify the RPC URL by passing
the `--rpc <RPC URL>` parameter. We recommend that you also assign an alias to the network by passing
the `--alias <ALIAS>` parameter so you can easily access this env in the future.

```shell
iota client new-env --alias local --rpc http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

#### Connect to the local env

After [creating the env](#create-a-local-env), you can use the `switch`  command to set it as the current active
environment:

```
iota client switch --env local
```

You can check the current active environment with the following command, which should return the environment alias you
assigned:

```bash
iota client active-env
```

#### Show the current active address

The IOTA Client CLI will default to the active address if you don't specify an address. You can use the following
command to show the current active address on your local network.

```
iota client active-address
```

:::tip Get All Addresses

You can also use the `iota client addresses` command to see all the addresses on your local network.

:::

#### Use the local faucet

Even though it's a local network, transactions still require [gas](../../about-iota/tokenomics/gas-in-iota.mdx). You can use

You can use the  `iota client faucet` command to get coins from your local faucet. Keep in mind that it may take up to
one minute
to complete your request. You can check if your coins have arrived using the `iota client gas` command.

:::info Faucet Help

The `faucet` command uses the active address and the active network environment by default. If you need to pass in a
different address or faucet server URL, check the `help` menu. If you're using a different network than a local
or public one, you must pass the URL to the faucet server.

:::

:::note IOTA Wallet

To send coins to a
IOTA Wallet is connected to your local network. See [Set up a local IOTA Wallet](#set-up-a-local-iota-wallet). You can use
the address for the local IOTA Wallet with the faucet.

:::

#### Check the gas coin objects for the active address

After you [get coins from the faucet](#use-the-local-faucet), you can use the following command to view the coin objects
for the address:

```shell
iota client gas
```

The response resembles the following, but with different IDs:

```shell
╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────╮
│ gasCoinId                                                          │ gasBalance │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────┤
│ 0x1d790713c1c3441a307782597c088f11230c47e609af2cec97f393123ea4de45 │ 200000000  │
│ 0x20c1d5ad2e8693953fca09fd2fec0fbc52a787e0a0f77725220d36a09a5b312d │ 200000000  │
│ [...]                                                              │            │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────╯
```

:::tip explorer

In order to use the explorer locally users can use the deployed explorer and set another endpoint like this: [https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/?network=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9000](https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/?network=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9000) or manually provide a Custom RPC URL on the [Explorer](https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/) page in the top right corner.

:::

:::warning HTTPS only

The [IOTA Explorer](https://explorer.rebased.iota.org) requires a secure HTTPS connection. If your local network doesn't support HTTPS, consider [running your own instance of the Explorer](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/apps/explorer#iota-explorer).

## Install IOTA Wallet Locally

### Prerequisites

* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Install Dependencies

After you install `pnpm`, you should run the following command from the root folder of IOTA to install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Build

After the installation completes, run the following command to build the IOTA Wallet:

```shell
pnpm turbo build
```

### Set Up a Local IOTA Wallet

You can use a local IOTA Wallet to test with your local network.

#### Configure the Wallet


Run the following command from the `iota` root folder to start the IOTA Wallet on your local network:

```bash
pnpm wallet build
```

### Add a Local IOTA Wallet to Chrome

After you build your local version of IOTA Wallet, you can add the extension to Chrome:

1. Open a Chrome browser to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Click the **Developer mode** toggle to enable if it's not already on.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select your `apps/wallet/dist` directory in your local copy of the [IOTA repository](../advanced/iota-repository.mdx).

Consult the IOTA
Wallet [Readme](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/main/apps/wallet/README.md#install-the-extension-to-chrome) for
more information on working with a locally built wallet on Chrome is needed.

## Generate example data

Use the TypeScript SDK to add example data to your network.

:::note

Before running the command, you must complete the `Prerequisites for Building Apps locally` section.

:::

Run the following command from the `iota` root folder:

```bash
pnpm --filter @iota/iota-sdk test:e2e
```

For additional information about example data for testing, see [https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/sdk/typescript#testing](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/sdk/typescript#testing).

## Troubleshooting

If you do not use [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/de/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce), you might see the
following message:

`Retrying requesting from the faucet: Retry failed: fetch is not defined`

To resolve this, switch or update to Node.js 18 and then try again.

## Test with the IOTA TypeScript SDK

The published version of the IOTA TypeScript SDK might be an earlier version than the version of IOTA you installed for
your local network. To make sure you're using the latest version of the SDK, use a local built version of SDK.

In your local checkout of the [IOTA repository](../advanced/iota-repository.mdx) make sure you are using the same branch as the network you are developing against. Run
```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
```
in the `<PATH_TO_YOUR_REPO>/iota/sdk/typescript` folder to compile the SDK.

To use the local built SDK in your project go to your project folder and execute

```bash
pnpm add <PATH_TO_YOUR_REPO>/sdk/typescript
```

and the locally compiled version of `@iota/iota-sdk` package will be installed for your application.
