# Create a Move Package

Once you have [installed IOTA](iota-install.mdx), you are ready to create your first IOTA
Move [package](../iota-101/iota-move-concepts/packages/packages.mdx). In IOTA, packages are the way to organize
the [modules](create-a-module.mdx) that make up your smart contract program. When you publish a package to any IOTA
network, it will be assigned an address you can use to interact with the package by
issuing [transactions](../iota-101/transactions/transactions.mdx).

Use the following command to create a standard package:

```shell
iota move new my_first_package
```

The command will create and populate the `my_first_package` directory with a skeleton for an IOTA Move project,
consisting of the following files and directories:

## `Move.toml`

The `Move.toml` file is the package's manifest. It describes the package and its dependencies.

:::tip Comments in `.toml` files
In `.toml` files, use the hash mark (`#`) to denote a comment.
:::

```move title="my_first_package/Move.toml"
[package]
name = "my_first_package"

# edition = "2024.beta " # To use the Move 2024 edition, currently in beta
# license = ""           # e.g., "MIT", "GPL", "Apache 2.0"
# authors = ["..."]      # e.g., ["Joe Smith (joesmith@noemail.com)", "John Snow (johnsnow@noemail.com)"]

[dependencies]
IOTA = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git", subdir = "crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }

# For remote import, use the `{ git = "...", subdir = "...", rev = "..." }`.
# Revision can be a branch, a tag, and a commit hash.
# MyRemotePackage = { git = "https://some.remote/host.git", subdir = "remote/path", rev = "main" }

# For local dependencies use `local = path`. Path is relative to the package root
# Local = { local = "../path/to" }

# To resolve a version conflict and force a specific version for dependency
# override use `override = true`
# Override = { local = "../conflicting/version", override = true }

[addresses]
my_first_package = "0x0"

# Named addresses will be accessible in Move as `@name`. They're also exported:
# for example, `std = "0x1"` is exported by the Standard Library.
# alice = "0xA11CE"

[dev-dependencies]
# The dev-dependencies section allows overriding dependencies for `--test` and
# `--dev` modes. You can introduce test-only dependencies here.
# Local = { local = "../path/to/dev-build" }

[dev-addresses]
# The dev-addresses section allows overwriting named addresses for the `--test`
# and `--dev` modes.
# alice = "0xB0B"
```

### Package

The `[package]` section describes the package. By default, the `iota move new` command populates only the `name` value
of the metadata.

- `name`: The package name when it is imported.
- `version`: The package version. It can be used in release management.
- `edition`: The edition of the Move language; currently, the only valid value is `2024`.

### Dependencies

The `[dependencies]` section specifies the dependencies of the project. The dependency specification can be a git
repository URL or a path to the local directory.

```rust
# git repository
iota = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git", subdir = "crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }

# local directory
MyPackage = { local = "../my-package" }
```

Packages also import addresses from other packages. For example, the IOTA dependency adds the `std` and `iota` addresses
to the project. These addresses can be used in the code as aliases for the addresses.

### Resolving Version Conflicts with `override`

If you have two dependencies that use different versions of the same package, you can override the dependency in
the `[dependencies]` section. To do so, add the `override` field to the dependency. The version specified in
the `[dependencies]` section will be used instead of the one specified in the dependency itself.

```rust
[dependencies]
iota = { override = true, git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git", subdir = "crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }
```

### Dev-dependencies

You can also add a `[dev-dependencies]` section to the manifest to override dependencies in the dev and test modes. For
example, if you want to use a different version of the IOTA package in dev mode, you can add a custom dependency
specification to the `[dev-dependencies]` section.

### Addresses

The `[addresses]` section is used to add aliases for the addresses you use in your package. You can add any address in
this section, and then use its alias in the code instead of the actual address. For example, if you
add `alice = "0xA11CE"` to this section, you can use `alice` as `0xA11CE` in the code.

### Dev-addresses

Much like the `[dev-dependencies]` section, you can also define `[dev-addresses]` to override the addresses you defined
in the `[addresses]` section for test and dev modes.

:::note Override Only
You cannot introduce new aliases in this section, only override the ones you defined in [`[addresses]`](#addresses).

## TOML Styles

The TOML format supports two styles for tables: inline and multiline. The examples above use the inline style, but it is
also possible to use the multiline style. You wouldn't want to use it for the `[package]` section, but it can be useful
for the dependencies.

<Tabs groupId="toml-style">
<TabItem label="Inline" value="inline">

```move
[dependencies]
iota = { override = true, git = "", subdir = "crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }
MyPackage = { local = "../my-package" }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Multiline" value="multiline">
```move
[dependencies.iota]
override = true
git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git"
subdir = "crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework"
rev = "framework/testnet"

[dependencies.MyPackage]
local = "../my-package"

```
</TabItem>
