# Connect to an IOTA Network

You can use the following networks to develop on IOTA. If you are still developing your application, you should use the
Devnet or Testnet, as these networks provide convenient faucets for test tokens.

## Devnet

The latest stable release. As such, it has the latest features that were tested in the `development` branch of
  the repository.
## Testnet

Once a release has been battle-tested in the Devnet, it moves to the Testnet. You can use this network to
  test your software in real-world conditions.

## Mainnet

The fully operational production network, with data persistence and where tokens have real value.

:::tip Local Networks

You can also spin up a [local IOTA network](local-network.mdx) for local development.

## IOTA CLI

IOTA provides [IOTA command line interface (CLI)](/references/cli/client.mdx) to interact with IOTA networks:

- Create and manage your private keys
- Create example NFTs
- Call and publish Move modules

You can use the [CLI](iota-environment.mdx#iota-cli) or [SDKs](iota-environment.mdx#iota-sdks) to send transactions and
read requests from using the [JSON-RPC](../../references/iota-api/json-rpc-format.mdx) and the following
endpoint: `https://fullnode.<IOTA-NETWORK-VERSION>.iota.io:443`.

## Environment Set Up

First, [Install IOTA](iota-install.mdx). After you install IOTA, [request IOTA test tokens](get-coins.mdx) for the
network you are using. If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from
your [local faucet](local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet).

To check whether IOTA is already installed, run the following command:

```shell
which iota
```

If IOTA is installed, the command returns the path to the IOTA binary. If IOTA is not installed, it
returns `iota not found`.
