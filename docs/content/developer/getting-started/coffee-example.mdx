title: Getting Started with Move Coffee Token Tutorial
---

## Introduction

Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on [Move](https://move-language.github.io/move/) programming! You will build a simple Coffee Shop example that allows customers to buy, claim, and transfer coffee tokens. The example demonstrates fundamental concepts like importing modules, defining [constants](https://move-language.github.io/move/constants.html), creating [structs](https://move-language.github.io/move/structs-and-resources.html), minting and burning tokens, and handling [control](https://move-language.github.io/move/loops.html) flow.

### Key Concepts Covered

1. [**Importing modules**](https://moved.network/docs/move-basics/importing-modules): You will import essential Move packages for transactions, tokens, and balances.
2. [**Defining constants**](https://move-language.github.io/move/constants.html): Used to represent error codes and set a price for coffee.
3. **Creating [structs](https://move-language.github.io/move/structs-and-resources.html) with [abilities](https://move-language.github.io/move/abilities.html)**: Defined the `COFFEE` and `CoffeeShop` structs to represent tokens and shop data.
4. [**Initialization with OTW**](../iota-101/move-overview/one-time-witness.mdx): Set up the shop with its treasury cap for minting tokens.
5. [**Control flow with assertions**](https://move-language.github.io/move/loops.html): Ensured correct amounts and balances in transactions.
6. **[Transferring](../iota-101/objects/transfers/transfers.mdx) and burning tokens**: Demonstrated how tokens are moved between users and how they can be consumed (burned).

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts like [tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/tokens#:~:text=A%20token%20is%20a%20representation,them%2C%20create%20or%20destroy%20them.) and [transactions](https://www.scalingparrots.com/en/what-is-a-blockchain-transaction/).
- Basic understanding of the [Move](https://move-language.github.io/move/)
- [Install Iota CLI](iota-install.mdx)

## 1. Create an IOTA Move Package

Use the following command to create a standard IOTA Move [package](create-a-package.mdx) called `coffee_shop`:

``` bash
iota move new coffee_shop
```

The command will create and populate the `coffee_shop` directory with a skeleton for an IOTA Move project. To add a [module](create-a-module.mdx), create a `.move` file in the sources directory, and call it `coffee.move`. In `coffee.move`, paste the following codes to the `coffee` module:

## 2. Importing Modules from the IOTA Package

The first step in our program is importing necessary modules from the IOTA package. These modules provide functionalities for transaction handling, coins, balances, and tokens.

<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

```move
    use iota::tx_context::sender;
    use iota::coin::{Self, TreasuryCap, Coin};
    use iota::balance::{Self, Balance};
    use iota::token::{Self, Token};
    use iota::iota::IOTA;
```
</details>

- [`iota::tx_context::sender`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/tx_context.mdx): Manages the transaction context.
- [`iota::coin`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx): Handles the creation and management of coins.
- [`iota::balance`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/balance.mdx): Manages the balance of the shop.
- [`iota::token`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/token.mdx): Manages the minting, transfer, and burning of tokens.
- [`iota::iota::IOTA`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/iota.mdx): The IOTA cryptocurrency module.

## 3. Defining Constants

In this step, you should define a few constants that represent different error codes and the price of a coffee. [Constants](https://move-language.github.io/move/constants.html) in Move are useful for defining fixed values used throughout the code.

<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

```move
const EIncorrectAmount: u64 = 0;
const ENotEnoughPoints: u64 = 1;
const COFFEE_PRICE: u64 = 10_000_000_000;  // 10 IOTA for a coffee
```

</details>

- `EIncorrectAmount`: Error when the wrong amount is provided.
- `ENotEnoughPoints`: Error when there aren’t enough points to complete a transaction.
- `COFFEE_PRICE`: The price of a coffee (10 IOTA).

## 4. Creating Structs with Abilities

[Structs](https://move-language.github.io/move/structs-and-resources.html) in Move represent data storage objects, and you will define two structs in this program.

[Abilities](https://docs.iota.org/developer/getting-started/create-a-module#abilities) in Move are a typing feature in Move that control what actions are permissible for values of a given type.

1. `COFFEE`: A token struct representing coffee points.
2. `CoffeeShop`: A struct for the coffee shop that includes its treasury cap and IOTA balance.

<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

```move
public struct COFFEE has drop {}

public struct CoffeeShop has key {
    id: UID,
    coffee_points: TreasuryCap<COFFEE>,
    balance: Balance<IOTA>,
}
```

</details>

- `COFFEE`: A token with the ability drop, allowing it to be destroyed when no longer needed.
- `CoffeeShop`: Represents a shop that has an ID, a treasury for minting coffee points, and a balance in IOTA.

## 5. Initialization with OneTimeWitness (OTW)

In Move, the [init](../iota-101/move-overview/init.mdx) function plays a critical role during the module's lifecycle, executing only once at the moment of module publication.
The init function initializes the CoffeeShop by creating the COFFEE token and defining the shop’s treasury cap and balance.

A [One-Time Witness (OTW)](../iota-101/move-overview/one-time-witness.mdx) is a unique type in Move, specifically designed to ensure that certain actions within a module can only occur once, providing security for the system's setup.

### Function Arguments

- `otw: COFFEE`: A token witness that allows the creation of the COFFEE tokens. It ensures that the token setup can only happen once during initialization.
- `ctx: &mut TxContext`: The transaction context, which provides necessary data about the current transaction, including the sender and other blockchain-related information

<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

```move
fun init(otw: COFFEE, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    let (coffee_points, metadata) = coin::create_currency(
        otw, 0, b"COFFEE", b"Coffee Point",
        b"Buy 4 coffees and get 1 free",
        std::option::none(),
        ctx
    );

    iota::transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
    iota::transfer::share_object(CoffeeShop {
        coffee_points,
        id: object::new(ctx),
        balance: balance::zero(),
    });
}
```

</details>

Here, you use the OneTimeWitness (OTW) pattern, where `COFFEE` is used as a witness to authorize the creation of a new currency called `COFFEE`. The shop’s balance starts at zero.

## 6. Buying a Coffee (Token Transfer)

The `buy_coffee` function enables customers to purchase coffee using IOTA tokens. In this process, you will also apply control flow using assertions to ensure the customer has sufficient funds. If the required conditions are met, the transaction proceeds; otherwise, an error is triggered, making this a crucial aspect of program logic.

### Function Arguments

- `app: &mut CoffeeShop`: A mutable reference to the `CoffeeShop` struct, which holds the shop's token treasury and balance.
- `payment: Coin<IOTA>`: The amount of IOTA tokens that the customer pays for the coffee. This is a `Coin` type representing IOTA currency.
- `ctx: &mut TxContext`: The transaction context that handles information about the sender and the blockchain transaction.

<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

```move
public fun buy_coffee(app: &mut CoffeeShop, payment: Coin<IOTA>, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    assert!(coin::value(&payment) > COFFEE_PRICE, EIncorrectAmount);

    let token = token::mint(&mut app.coffee_points, 1, ctx);
    let request = token::transfer(token, sender(ctx), ctx);

    token::confirm_with_treasury_cap(&mut app.coffee_points, request, ctx);
    coin::put(&mut app.balance, payment);
    iota::event::emit(CoffeePurchased {})
}
```

</details>

This function performs key tasks like checking the customer’s balance, minting 1 new `COFFEE` token, transferring it to the customer, and confirming the transaction.

## 7. Control Flow with Assertions

Move uses assertions (`assert!`) to enforce logical conditions during execution. If an assertion fails, it aborts the function with the defined error code.

<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

```move
assert!(coin::value(&payment) > COFFEE_PRICE, EIncorrectAmount);
```

</details>

In this example, you will ensure the customer has enough IOTA to buy coffee. If not, it returns the `EIncorrectAmount` error.

## 8. Claiming a Free Coffee (Burning Tokens)

After purchasing 4 coffees, customers can claim a free coffee by burning their `COFFEE` points. In Move, burning tokens permanently removes them from circulation, ensuring they can’t be reused. This process is vital in controlling token supply and enforcing business logic in applications.

### Function Arguments

- `app: &mut CoffeeShop`: A mutable reference to the `CoffeeShop` struct, holding the shop’s treasury cap and token information.
- `points: Token<COFFEE>`: The `COFFEE` tokens that the customer is using to claim a free coffee. The token value must equal 4 for the transaction to proceed.
- `ctx: &mut TxContext`: The transaction context, which includes details about the sender and the blockchain transaction.

<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

```move
public fun claim_free(app: &mut CoffeeShop, points: Token<COFFEE>, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    assert!(token::value(&points) == 4, EIncorrectAmount);

    let request = token::spend(points, ctx);
    token::confirm_with_treasury_cap(&mut app.coffee_points, request, ctx);
    iota::event::emit(CoffeePurchased {})
}
```

</details>

This function ensures the customer has exactly 4 points, spends them, and emits a purchase event, marking the reward for loyalty.

## 9. Transferring Tokens

The `transfer` function enables customers to [transfer](../../references/framework/iota-framework/transfer.mdx) their `COFFEE` tokens to others, but with a 1-point fee deducted as commission. This demonstrates how Move can enforce rules and fees during token transfers, ensuring a fair system of exchange.

### Function Arguments

- `app: &mut CoffeeShop`: A mutable reference to the `CoffeeShop` struct, which includes the shop's treasury and balance information.
- `mut points: Token<COFFEE>`: The `COFFEE` tokens being transferred. The token value is mutable because 1 token will be deducted as a transfer fee.
- `recipient: address`: The recipient's blockchain address to which the tokens will be transferred.
- `ctx: &mut TxContext`: The transaction context that includes details about the sender and manages interaction with the blockchain.

<details>
<summary>Click to view code</summary>

```move
public fun transfer(
    app: &mut CoffeeShop,
    mut points: Token<COFFEE>,
    recipient: address,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    assert!(token::value(&points) > 1, ENotEnoughPoints);

    let commission = token::split(&mut points, 1, ctx);
    let request = token::transfer(points, recipient, ctx);

    token::confirm_with_treasury_cap(&mut app.coffee_points, request, ctx);
    token::burn(&mut app.coffee_points, commission);
    }
```

</details>

The function first checks if the user has enough points, splits off 1 point as the transfer fee, sends the remaining points to the recipient, and burns the 1-point commission from the system's treasury, removing it from circulation.

## 10. Building your Package

You can use the `iota move build` command to [build](build-test.mdx) Move packages in the working directory, `coffee_shop` in this case.

```bash
iota move build
```

## 11. Publish the `coffee_shop` package by running the following command:

```bash
iota client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

The console will respond with the transaction effects. You should pay attention to the created objects to retrieve the object IDs:

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you explored the basics of Move programming by building a simple Coffee Shop application. You learned how to import modules, define constants, create structs, mint and burn tokens, and manage control flow with assertions. With this foundational knowledge, you can now begin experimenting with more advanced Move features and expand your decentralized applications. Happy coding!
