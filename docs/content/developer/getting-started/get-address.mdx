title: Get IOTA Address
description: You need an address on the IOTA network before you can start trading NFTs, purchase IOTA tokens, or perform other transactions.

An address is a way to uniquely and anonymously identify an account that exists on the IOTA blockchain network. In other words, an address is a way for a user to store and use tokens on the IOTA network, without providing any personally identifying information (such as email address, phone number, and so on). For example, if you want to purchase a number of IOTA tokens to play a game, you must specify an address where these tokens are to be deposited.

The IOTA address is unique, similarly to the way a social security number or a personal identification number is unique to one person. However, in IOTA you can create and own multiple addresses, all of which are unique. 

In IOTA, an address is 32 bytes and is often encoded in base58 with `0x` prefix. For example, this is a valid IOTA address: `0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331`. You can use the a IOTA network explorer to find more information about this address and the objects it owns.

If you'd like to understand how a IOTA address is derived from private keys and other cryptography related topics, see the [Keys and Addresses](../cryptography/explanations/transaction-auth/keys-addresses.mdx) topic.


## How to obtain a IOTA address

IOTA provides multiple ways to obtain a IOTA address. The following are the two most common. 

### Command line interface

If you are using the IOTA command line interface (CLI) to interact with the IOTA network, you can use the `iota client` command to generate a new address. By default, when the IOTA CLI runs for the first time it will prompt you to set up your local wallet, and then it generates one IOTA address and the associated secret recovery phrase. Make sure you write down the secret recovery phrase and store it in a safe place. 


To generate a new IOTA address use `iota client new-address ed25519`, which specifies the keypair scheme flag to be of type `ed25519`.

For more information, see the [IOTA Client CLI](../../references/cli/client.mdx) documentation.

To see all the generated addresses in the local wallet on your machine, run `iota keytool list`. For more information about the keytool options, see the [IOTA Keytool CLI](../../references/cli/keytool.mdx) documentation.

:::danger

The private keys associated with the IOTA addresses are stored locally on the machine where the CLI is installed, in the `~/.iota/iota_config/iota.keystore` file. Make sure you do not expose this to anyone, as they can use it to get access to your account.
