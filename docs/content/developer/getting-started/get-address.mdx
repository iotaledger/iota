# Create an Address

## What's an Account?

In IOTA, users are not identified by email or personal information but by an account and its
associated [address](#whats-an-address). The account is generated from a private key, which could be
derived from a mnemonic. Accounts can own any type of [object](../iota-101/objects/object-model.mdx) and send
transactions.

## What's an Address?

An address is a way to uniquely and anonymously identify an [account](#whats-an-account)
or [package](../iota-101/move-overview/package-upgrades/introduction.mdx). In the same way your email or ID number is
unique, addresses have to be unique as they are your account's identifier to send and receive transactions. You
can [create any number of addresses](#create-an-iota-address), all of which will be unique.

### Address Structure

In IOTA, an address is 64 characters (32 bytes) long and is often encoded as a case-insensitive hexadecimal string prefixed with `0x` prefix. For example, this is a valid IOTA
address: `0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331`.

:::tip IOTA Explorer

You can use the [IOTA network explorer](https://explorer.iota.org/) to find more information about this address and the
objects it owns.

:::warning Legacy address format

In IOTA Stardust we used a different address standard by default (Bech32, starting with `iota1` and `smr1`). To read more about this change check out the [address details migration page](../stardust/addresses.mdx).

### Reserved Addresses

In IOTA, there are reserved addresses that identify standard packages and objects. Reserved
addresses are typically simple values that are easy to remember and type. For example, the address of the Standard Library is `0x1`. Addresses shorter than 32 bytes are padded with zeros to the left.

```move
0x1 = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

Here are some examples of reserved addresses:

- `0x1` - address of the IOTA Move Standard Library (alias `std`)
- `0x2` - address of the IOTA Framework (alias `iota`)
- `0x6` - address of the system `Clock` object

## Create an IOTA address

IOTA provides multiple ways to obtain an IOTA address. The following are the two most common.

:::note Supported Address Types

IOTA supports multiple signature schemes for account generation. The currently supported curves
are `ed25519`, `secp256k1`, and `secp256r1`.

### IOTA Wallet

The simplest way to generate an IOTA address is using the [IOTA Wallet Chrome browser extension](TODO UPDATE LINK).
After you install the extension, there are several ways to create an address.

Open the Chrome IOTA Wallet browser extension and then:

- Click **More Options** â†’ **Create a new passphrase account**. Then, follow the on-screen instructions.

For more information on the IOTA Wallet and how to keep it secure, see
the [IOTA Wallet documentation](../../about-iota/iota-wallet/getting-started.mdx).

### Command Line Interface

#### Your first address

When you start the CLI for the first time, it will prompt you to set up a local wallet, which naturally has an address,
so it can receive and send funds.

:::danger Recovery phrase

Please write down the recovery phrase associated with your address and keep it in a safe place.

:::

#### Generate Address

You can use the  [IOTA Client CLI](../../references/cli/client.mdx) to generate any number of addresses by using
the `iota client new-address <AddressType>`, where `<AddresType>` is one of the following:

* `ed25519`
* `secp256k1`
* `secp256r1`

#### List Addresses

You can list all the addresses associated with your local wallet with
the [IOTA Keytool CLI](../../references/cli/keytool.mdx) by running the following command:

```bash
iota keytool list
```

:::danger Private Keys

The private keys associated with the IOTA addresses are stored locally on the machine where the CLI is installed in
the `~/.iota/iota_config/iota.keystore` file. Anyone who can access that file can take control of your account, so you
should not share it with anyone.
