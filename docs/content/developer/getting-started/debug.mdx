# Debugging

Move does not currently have a built-in debugger. However, you can leverage the `std::debug` module to print various values directly to the console. This approach helps you observe and understand the behavior and logic of your modules. Start by importing the debug module into your source file:

```move
use std::debug;
```

To print a variable `v`, irrespective of its type, use the following code:

```move
debug::print(&v);
```

If `v` is already a reference, you can use:

```move
debug::print(v);
```

Additionally, the debug module offers a function to display the current stack trace:

```move
debug::print_stack_trace();
```

Moreover, if an abort or assertion fails, the stack trace at that failure point is automatically printed.

## Implementing Debug in `first_package`

To demonstrate the use of the `std::debug` module, update your `first_package` by integrating debug statements. Specifically, modify the `new_sword` function to output the `forge` value both before and after incrementing `swords_created`. Incorporate a `print_stack_trace` as well, resulting in the following function:

```move
/// Constructor for creating swords.
public fun new_sword(forge: &mut Forge, magic: u64, strength: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext): Sword {
    debug::print(forge);

    // Increment the `swords_created` counter.
    forge.swords_created = forge.swords_created + 1;

    debug::print(forge);
    debug::print_stack_trace();

    // Create a sword.
    Sword {
        id: object::new(ctx),
        magic: magic,
        strength: strength,
    }
}
```

To view the output, execute the module's tests:

```shell
$ iota move test test_sword_transactions
```

This will display the expected results as the test calls the `new_sword` function:

```shell
