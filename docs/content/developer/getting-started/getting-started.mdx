# Getting Started

IOTA Rebased introduces layer 1 Move smart contracts to the IOTA ecosystem. This valuable addition enhances IOTA by
offering programmability on layer1, complementing [IOTA EVM](../../about-iota/about-iota.mdx#iota-evm-and-shimmer-evm) on layer 2.

The guides in this section will guide you as you start your IOTA Rebased journey. We recommend that you start
by [setting up your development environment](iota-environment.mdx), and then move on
to [install IOTA](install-iota.mdx).

## GraphQL queries

Use the GraphQL service for IOTA RPC to interact with on-chain data. 

Go to [Query IOTA RPC with GraphQL](getting-started/graphql-rpc.mdx).

## What's Next?

If you are already familiar with the basics, you can try the following sections:

- [Create a Move Package](create-a-package.mdx): Learn by writing, building, and publishing a simple dApp.
- [IOTA 101](../iota-101.mdx): Get an overview of
  the [Move concepts](../iota-101/move-overview/move-overview.mdx) you'll use as a foundation to
  build [create coins, tokens](../iota-101/create-coin/create-coin.mdx) and [NFTs](../iota-101/nft/create-nft.mdx) using the
  Move's [Object Model](../iota-101/objects/object-model.mdx).
- [From Solidity/EVM to Move](../evm-to-move/evm-to-move.mdx): If you're an experienced Solidity developer, check out
  the key differences between developing on Move.
- [Cryptography](../cryptography.mdx): Leverage multiple cryptographic algorithms to
  create secure and flexible smart contracts applications.
