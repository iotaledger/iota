In order to deploy your contracts and interact with the chains some tooling is required. IOTA Rebased has an excellent command-line tool that can be used for the most common tasks.

The simplest way to get up and running with IOTA is to [install the binary](#install-from-binaries) from the latest
release available in the [IOTA Rebased GitHub Repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/). Make sure to download
the version that matches the network you want to work on.

You can also use the
convenient [docker images in the repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/docker) to run your own
local network.

If you require full control over the installation sources and process, you can
always [build the binaries yourself from source](#install-from-source).

## Supported operating systems

IOTA supports the following operating systems:

- Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 (Bionic Beaver) or later
- macOS - macOS Monterey or later
- Microsoft Windows - Windows 10 or later

## Install Using a Package Manager

You can use the following commands to let a package manager handle the installation process. You can
use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux
or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem label="Homebrew" value="mac">

```bash
brew install iota
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Chocolatey" value="win">

```shell
choco install iota
```

Find more [versions of IOTA for Windows](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/iota) on the Chocolatey community
website. TODO Check Link availability

## Install From Binaries

You can find a set of binaries for most operating systems with
each [IOTA release](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/releases) that you can use to install IOTA. We recommend using
the latest stable release for the network you are working on.

Once you have downloaded and extracted the `.tgz` file that matches your operating system, you should open the folder
and
install the necessary binaries. You should start with the main IOTA binary.

1. iota-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Main IOTA binary.
2. iota-faucet-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Local faucet to mint coins on a local network.
3. iota-indexer-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: An indexer for a local IOTA network.
4. iota-node-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Run a local node.
5. iota-tool-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Provides utilities for IOTA.

:::note

This process may take several minutes to download and install; this depends on your network and PC specifications.

:::

### Test

You can quickly test if you have successfully installed the binaries by running the following command:

```bash
iota
```

It should output a message stating the currently installed IOTA version and some helpful commands.

## Install From Source

You can use this section to install the Rust crates (packages) to interact with IOTA networks, including the IOTA CLI,
from source.

:::tip

You can also download the [source code](../advanced/iota-repository.mdx) to access files locally.

:::

## Prerequisites

Please ensure you install the following before attempting to install IOTA from source.

### Rust and Cargo

#### Install

Like most Rust projects, IOTA uses Cargo as a package manager. You can find detailed instructions
on how to install Rust and Cargo for your OS in
the [official Rust Documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

You can use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Update

Since IOTA uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies, you may need
to [update](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). The recommended update method is using `rustup`, as shown below:

```bash
rustup update stable
```

### Additional Prerequisites by Operating System

Select the appropriate tab to view the requirements for your system.

## Install IOTA Binaries From Source

Run the following command to install IOTA binaries from the `testnet` branch:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git --branch testnet iota
```

:::info Alternative releases

Replace `testnet` with another branch if needed when working on anything besides the testnet. Common options would be `develop` for the absolute latest version, `devnet` and `mainnet`.
See the [repository details](../advanced/iota-repository.mdx) for more information on commonly used branches.

:::

The installation process can take a while to complete. You can monitor the installation progress in the terminal. If you
If you encounter an error, install the latest version of all prerequisites and try the command again.

To update to the latest stable version of Rust:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

The command installs IOTA components in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

## Upgrade IOTA Binaries

If you previously installed the IOTA binaries, you can update them to the most recent release with the same command you
used to install them:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git --branch testnet iota
```
