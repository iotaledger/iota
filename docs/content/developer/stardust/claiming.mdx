### NFT Output

An address can own `NFTOutput` objects that needs to be unlocked. 
In this case, some off-chain queries can be used to check the unlock conditions of the `NFTOutput` and asses if it can be unlocked. 
Check the example above, as it works the same as the [`Basic Output`](#basic-output).
    
#### Claim of a NFT Output
Once a NFT Output can be unlocked the claim of its assets can start

1. The first step is to fetch the `NftOutput` object needed to be claimed.

2. Then we check the native tokens that possibily were held by this output. A `Bag` is used for holding these tokens, so in this step we are interested in obtaining the dynamic field keys that are used as bag index. In the case of the native tokens `Bag` the keys are strings representing the `OTW` used for the native token `Coin`.

3. Finally, a PTB can be created using the `nft_output` as input and the `Bag` keys for iterating the native tokens extracted.
The NFT is different from the `basic output` as it contains the NFT object, the main purpose of claiming is extracting Nft object from the `Nft output`.
