## Examples of Stardust asset claim transactions

In the following, some examples of transactions for claiming the Stardust assets will be presented. Different commands in a [PTB](../iota-101/transactions/ptb/prog-txn-blocks.mdx) are used depending on the claiming scenario, that varies depending on the Stardust Output type and composition.

### Basic Output

An address can own `BasicOutput` objects that needs to be unlocked. In this case, some off-chain queries can be used to check the unlock conditions of the `BasicOutput` and asses if it can be unlocked.

#### Claim of a Basic Output
Once a Basic Output can be unlocked the claim of its assets can start

1. The first step is to fetch the `BasicOutput` object needed to be claimed.

```rust file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/rust/stardust/basic-output-claim.rs#L74-L99
```

</Tabs>


2. Then we check the native tokens that possibily were held by this output. A `Bag` is used for holding these tokens, so in this step we are interested in obtaining the dynamic field keys that are used as bag index. In the case of the native tokens `Bag` the keys are strings representing the `OTW` used for the native token `Coin`.

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

</Tabs>

3. Finally, a PTB can be created using the `basic_output` as input and the `Bag` keys for iterating the native tokens extracted.

### Nft Output

An address can own `NftOutput` objects that needs to be unlocked. 
In this case, some off-chain queries can be used to check the unlock conditions of the `NftOutput` and asses if it can be unlocked. 
Check the example above, as it works the same as the [`Basic Output`](#basic-output).
    
#### Claim of a Nft Output
Once a Nft Output can be unlocked the claim of its assets can start

1. The first step is to fetch the `NftOutput` object needed to be claimed.

2. Then we check the native tokens that possibily were held by this output. A `Bag` is used for holding these tokens, so in this step we are interested in obtaining the dynamic field keys that are used as bag index. In the case of the native tokens `Bag` the keys are strings representing the `OTW` used for the native token `Coin`.

</Tabs>

3. Finally, a PTB can be created using the `nft_output` as input and the `Bag` keys for iterating the native tokens extracted.
An Nft Output is different from a Basic Output as it contains the `Nft` object. 
In fact, the main purpose of claiming is extracting the `Nft` object from the `NftOutput`.
