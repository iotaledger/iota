title: Claiming Stardust Assets
description: Describes how to access the migrated assets and tokens
---

As detailed in the [Stardust Move Models](move-models.mdx), Stardust assets are represented as Move objects within the ledger. Claiming these assets involves enabling original owners to utilize a [Programmable Transaction Block](../iota-101/transactions/ptb/prog-txn-blocks.mdx) to "unlock" assets such as IOTA, Shimmer, custom [`Coin`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-coin)s, or even `Alias` and `Nft` objects. 

This process takes advantage of Move's unique features to ensure that assets are transferred and unlocked securely and efficiently to their rightful owners.


## Output types to Move Objects

Stardust assets come in the form of Outputs and each Output can be of a different type. For understanding how Outputs have been transformed into Move Objects based on their types, please refer to the [Stardust Move Models](move-models.mdx#summary) page. In here, one or more claiming examples for each Output type will be shown.


## Examples of Stardust asset claim transactions

In the following, some examples of transactions for claiming the Stardust assets will be presented. Different commands in a [PTB](../iota-101/transactions/ptb/prog-txn-blocks.mdx) are used depending on the claiming scenario, that varies depending on the Stardust Output type and composition.

### Basic Output

Go to [Basic Output](claiming/basic.mdx).

### Nft Output

Go to [Nft Output](claiming/nft.mdx).

### Alias Output

Go to [Alias Output](claiming/alias.mdx).

### Foundry Output

Go to [Foundry Output](claiming/foundry.mdx).

### Output unlockable by an Alias/Nft Address

Go to [Output unlockable by an Alias/Nft Address](claiming/address-unlock-condition.mdx).

## Sponsoring your Shimmer claiming

In the case in which some assets are owned by a Shimmer address that helds no IOTA tokens (needed to pay for gas), then a claiming can benefit by the process of self-sponsoring. This means that an address owning IOTA tokens can be used by the same user to sponsor a transaction claiming Shimmer assets. 

Go to [Self-sponsor Shimmer Claimings](claiming/self-sponsor.mdx).
