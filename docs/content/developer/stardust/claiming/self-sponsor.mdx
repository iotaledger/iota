# Self-Sponsoring Iota Assets Claims

<MigrationWarning/ >

If you own Iota assets but don't have any IOTA coins to cover transaction fees, 
self-sponsorship can help you claim those assets.
In this process, a sponsor (an IOTA address) pays the transaction gas fees for another address (the user).
When claiming assets, a sponsor can cover the gas fees required for the transaction.

## Claim an Iota Basic Output with Self-Sponsorship

### 1. Identify the Self-Sponsoring Address

Use the IOTA `coin_type` to derive the sponsor and sender addresses.

### 2. Create the PTB for Claiming

Next, create a [Programmable Transaction Block (PTB)](../../iota-101/transactions/ptb/building-programmable-transaction-blocks-ts-sdk.mdx)
to claim a `BasicOutput` owned by the derived Iota address.
This process is similar to the one outlined in the [Basic Output](basic.mdx) guide.

### 3. Sign the Transaction

For this transaction, both the sender address (the object's owner) and the sponsor address must sign the transaction.
