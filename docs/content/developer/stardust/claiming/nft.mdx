 title: Claiming Nft Outputs
---

An address can own `NftOutput` objects that needs to be unlocked. 
In this case, some off-chain queries can be used to check the unlock conditions of the `NftOutput` and assess if it can be unlocked. 
Check the example above, as it works the same as the [`Basic Output`](basic.mdx).
    
## Claim of an Nft Output
Once an Nft Output can be unlocked the claim of its assets can start

1. The first step is to fetch the `NftOutput` object that needs to be claimed.

2. Then we check the native tokens that were possibly held by this output. A [`Bag`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/bag) is used for holding these tokens, so in this step we are interested in obtaining the dynamic field keys that are used as bag index. In the case of the native tokens `Bag` the keys are strings representing the [`OTW`](../../iota-101/iota-move-concepts/one-time-witness.mdx) used for the native token [`Coin`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-coin).

3. Finally, a PTB can be created using the `nft_output` as input and the `Bag` keys for iterating the native tokens extracted.
An Nft Output is different from a Basic Output as it contains the `Nft` object. 
In fact, the main purpose of claiming is extracting the `Nft` object from the `NftOutput`.

## Conversion of an Nft Output into a custom Nft
This topic outlines the process of converting an stardust Nft into a custom Nft.

You need to have a prepared custom Nft package that you want to convert the Stardust Nft You need to have a prepared custom Nft package that you want to convert the Stardust Nft into. 
The following is an example of a simple module for representing a custom NFT, minting it, burning it and converting it from a Stardust `Nft`:

Create a PTB that extracts the Stardust `Nft` from an `NftOutput` and then converts it into a custom NFT of the collection just published. 
This conversion method extracts the Stardust `Nft` metadata and uses it for minting a new NFT.
