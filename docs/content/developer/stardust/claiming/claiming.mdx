## Examples of Stardust asset claim transactions

In the following, some examples of transactions for claiming the Stardust assets will be presented. Different commands in a [PTB](../../iota-101/transactions/ptb/prog-txn-blocks.mdx) are used depending on the claiming scenario, that varies depending on the Stardust Output type and composition.

### Basic Output

Go to [Basic Output](basic.mdx).

### Nft Output

Go to [Nft Output](nft.mdx).

### Alias Output

Go to [Alias Output](alias.mdx).

### Foundry Output

Go to [Foundry Output](foundry.mdx).

### Output unlockable by an Alias/Nft Address

Go to [Output unlockable by an Alias/Nft Address](address-uc.mdx).

## Sponsoring your Shimmer claiming

In the case in which some assets are owned by a Shimmer address that helds no IOTA tokens (needed to pay for gas), then a claiming can benefit by the process of self-sponsoring. This means that an address owning IOTA tokens can be used by the same user to sponsor a transaction claiming Shimmer assets. 

Go to [Self-sponsor Shimmer Claimings](self-sponsor.mdx).
