# Claiming an Output Unlockable by an Alias/NFT Address

<MigrationWarning/ >

In Stardust, outputs had an Address Unlock Condition or, in the case of Alias Outputs, 
a [Governor Address Unlock Condition](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/main/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#governor-address-unlock-condition). 
In the new ledger, this mechanism is represented by an address owning the associated Output object.
Most of the time, the address is directly managed by a user through a keypair.
However, sometimes the address could represent another object. 
In this case, that object owns the associated Output object.
After the [Stardust migration](../migration-process.mdx), only `Alias` and `Nft` objects can own other Output objects.

## Claiming an Output Owned by Another Alias/NFT Object

For this example, we use an `AliasOutput` to extract an `Alias` object that owns an `NftOutput`.

1. The first step is to fetch the `AliasOutput` object that is needed to claim the `NftOutput`.

2. Use the dynamic field function with the "alias" dynamic field key filter to gather the `Alias` object itself.

3. Some objects are owned by the `Alias` object. In this case, filter them by type using the `NftOutput` type tag. Apply the filter to get `NftOutput`s owned by the `Alias`.

4. Create a PTB that first extracts the assets from the `AliasOutput`, and then uses the extracted `Alias` to "address unlock" the `NftOutput` using the function `unlock_alias_address_owned_nft`.
