title: Transfers
---

Everything on IOTA is an object, and your smart contracts will often need to move these objects across the network,
transferring them from one owner to another.

## Custom Transfer Rules

IOTA allows you to define [custom transfer rules](custom-rules.mdx) for objects,
specifying the conditions that must be satisfied for a transfer to be valid.
However, note that objects with the `store` ability cannot have custom transfer rules,
as this ability allows for unrestricted transfers using [`iota::transfer::public_transfer`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/transfer#function-public_transfer)
or the `TransferObjects` transaction command.

## Transfer to Object

In addition to transferring objects to addresses, IOTA supports [transferring objects to other objects](transfer-to-object.mdx)..
In this case, the receiving object manages access control to the transferred object, adding an extra layer of security and control.
