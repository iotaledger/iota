title: Object and Package Versioning
description: Versioning provides the ability to upgrade packages and objects on the IOTA network.
---

In IOTA, every object stored on-chain is referenced by an ID and a version.
When a transaction modifies an object,
it creates a new version of that object while keeping the same ID.
This ensures a linear history for each object, where only the latest version is accessible to transactions.

## Object Versioning

### How Versioning Works

When a transaction modifies an object with ID `I`, it creates a new version with the same ID but a later version.
For example:

```
(I, v0) => ...
(I, v1) => ...  # v0 < v1
(I, v2) => ...  # v1 < v2
```

Even though multiple versions of the object may exist in the store,
only the latest version (`v2` in this example) is accessible to transactions.
The versioning system guarantees that only one transaction can modify an object at a time, ensuring a linear history.

Versions are strictly increasing, and (ID, version) pairs are never reused.
This allows node operators to prune old object versions if they choose,
although they might keep prior versions to serve requests for an object's history.

### Move Objects

IOTA uses [Lamport timestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp) in its versioning algorithm for objects.
The use of Lamport timestamps ensures that versions are never reused.
The new version for objects touched by a transaction is one greater than the latest version among all input objects to the transaction.
For example, a transaction transferring an object `O` at version 5 using a gas object `G` at version 3 updates both `O` and `G` to version 6.

#### Address-Owned Objects

[Address-owned objects](object-ownership/address-owned.mdx) must be referenced by their specific ID and version in a transaction.
When a validator signs a transaction using an owned object, that object version is locked to that transaction.
Validators will reject other transactions that attempt to use the same object version, preventing equivocation.

#### Immutable Objects

[Immutable objects](object-ownership/immutable.mdx) are referenced by their ID and version,
but they do not need to be locked since their contents and versions do not change.
The version is relevant because it identifies when the object became immutable.

#### Shared Objects

[Shared objects](object-ownership/shared.mdx) are referenced by their ID, the version they were shared at,
and whether they are accessed mutably.
The exact version accessed is determined during transaction scheduling by consensus,
ensuring proper sequencing of reads and writes.

#### Wrapped Objects

[Wrapped objects](object-ownership/wrapped.mdx) are accessed through the object that wraps them,
not directly by their ID.
For example, if an `Inner` object is wrapped inside an `Outer` object, you must access `Inner` via `Outer`.
Validators will reject transactions that directly reference wrapped objects. However, wrapped objects can be unwrapped, making them accessible by their ID again.

```move
module example::wrapped {

    public struct Inner has key, store {
        id: UID,
        x: u64,
    }

    public struct Outer has key {
        id: UID,
        inner: Inner,
    }

    entry fun make_wrapped(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let inner = Inner {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            x: 42,
        };

        let outer = Outer {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            inner,
        };

        transfer::transfer(outer, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }
}
```

When working with an `Outer` object the owner must specify it as the transaction input
to gain access to its `inner` field.
This allows interacting with the `Inner` instance within.
It's important to note that validators will reject any transactions that directly attempt to specify wrapped objects, 
such as the `inner` of an `Outer`, as inputs.

Consequently, when a transaction involves reading a wrapped object,
you aren't required to specify the version of that object.

Over time, wrapped objects may become "unwrapped," making them accessible again by their original ID:

```move
module example::wrapped {
    // ...

    entry fun unwrap(outer: Outer, ctx: &TxContext) {
        let Outer { id, inner } = outer;
        object::delete(id);
        transfer::transfer(inner, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }
}
```

The `unwrap` function in the above example operates by taking an instance of `Outer`, destroying it,
and returning the `Inner` object back to you, the sender.
Once this function is called the previous owner of `Outer`, can directly access `Inner` using its ID,
as it is now unwrapped.
Throughout the lifespan of an object, it can be wrapped and unwrapped multiple times,
yet it will always retain its original ID.

To prevent version re-use, the system employs a Lamport timestamp-based versioning scheme.
This ensures the version at which an object is unwrapped is always greater than the version at which it was wrapped.

Here’s how it works:

- After a wrapping transaction, `W`, where object `I` is wrapped within object `O`, the version of `O` must be greater than or equal to the version of `I`. This implies one of the following scenarios:
  - If `I` is an input, its version is strictly lower.
  - If `I` is newly created, its version is equal to `O`.
- After a subsequent transaction unwrapping `I` from `O`, the following conditions hold true:
  - The version of `O` as an input must be greater than or equal to its version after `W` because it is part of a later transaction, implying that the version has increased.
  - The version of `I` in the output must be strictly greater than the version of `O` as an input.

This leads to the following chain of inequalities for the version of `I` before wrapping:

- It is less than or equal to `O`'s version after wrapping.
- It is less than or equal to `O`'s version before unwrapping.
- It is less than the version of `I` after unwrapping.

So, the version of `I` before wrapping is always less than its version after unwrapping.


#### Dynamic Fields

From a versioning standpoint, dynamic fields behave similarly to wrapped objects:

- These fields are accessible only through their parent object, meaning they cannot be used as direct transaction inputs.
- Consequently, you don't need to include their IDs or versions in transaction inputs.
- The Lamport timestamp-based versioning ensures that when a field containing an object is removed, the object becomes accessible by its ID, with its version incremented to a unique, previously unused version.

:::info

One key difference between dynamic fields and wrapped objects is that if a transaction modifies a dynamic field,
its version is incremented during that transaction.
In contrast, a wrapped object's version remains unchanged.

:::

When you add a new dynamic field to a parent object,
it creates a `Field` object that links the field name and value to the parent.
Unlike other newly created objects,
the ID for this `Field` instance is not generated using [`iota::object::new`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/object.mdx#function-new).
Instead, it's computed as a hash of the parent object ID along with the field name’s type and value,
allowing you to look up the `Field` via its parent and name.

If you remove a field, IOTA deletes the associated `Field`, and if you add a new field with the same name,
IOTA generates a new instance with the same ID.
Lamport timestamp-based versioning, combined with the fact that dynamic fields are only accessible through their parent object,
guarantees that (ID, version) pairs are not reused:

- The transaction that deletes the original field increments the parent's version to a value greater than the deleted field's version.
- The transaction that creates the new version of the same field assigns it a version greater than the parent's current version.

So, the new `Field` instance will always have a version greater than the deleted one.

## Packages

Move packages are also versioned and stored on-chain, 
though they follow a distinct versioning scheme because they are immutable once created.
This means that when referencing a package in transaction inputs (such as the package a function belongs to in a Move call transaction),
you only need to specify the package ID, and it will always be loaded at its latest version.

### User Packages

Every time you publish or upgrade a package, IOTA generates a new ID.
A newly published package starts with version 1,
while an upgraded package has a version one greater than the previous version.
Unlike objects, older package versions remain accessible even after an upgrade.
For example, consider a package `P` that has been published and upgraded twice:

```
(0x17fb7f87e48622257725f584949beac81539a3f4ff864317ad90357c37d82605, 1) => P v1
(0x260f6eeb866c61ab5659f4a89bc0704dd4c51a573c4f4627e40c5bb93d4d500e, 2) => P v2
(0xd24cc3ec3e2877f085bc756337bf73ae6976c38c3d93a0dbaf8004505de980ef, 3) => P v3
```

In this example, each version of the package has a unique ID.
Despite the existence of `v2` and `v3`, you can still call functions in `v1`.

### Framework Packages

Framework packages (such as the Move standard library at `0x1`, the IOTA Framework at `0x2`, and IOTA System at `0x3`)
are unique in that their IDs must remain consistent across upgrades.
The network can upgrade these packages while keeping their IDs stable through a system transaction,
but this process can only occur at epoch boundaries since framework packages are considered immutable.
New versions of framework packages share the same ID as their predecessors, but their version increments by one:


```
(0x1, 1) => MoveStdlib v1
(0x1, 2) => MoveStdlib v2
(0x1, 3) => MoveStdlib v3
```

This example shows how the first three versions of the Move standard library would be represented on-chain.

### Package Versions

IOTA smart contracts are organized into upgradeable packages,
meaning that multiple versions of a given package can coexist on-chain.
Before a package can be used, you must first publish its initial version.
When upgrading a package, you create a new version, and each upgrade builds on the immediately preceding version in the version history.
This means that you can only upgrade from the `nth` version to the `(n+1)th` version.
For instance, after upgrading from version 1 to 2, you can only upgrade from version 2 to 3, not directly from version 1 to 3.

Versioning also exists in package manifest files, both in the package section and the dependencies section. Consider the following example of manifest code:

```toml
[package]
name = "some_pkg"
version = "1.0.0"
edition = "2024.beta"

[dependencies]
another_pkg = { git = "https://github.com/another_pkg/another_pkg.git" , version = "2.0.0"}
```

The version references in the manifest serve primarily for user-level documentation,
as the `publish` and `upgrade` commands do not utilize this information.
If you publish a package with a certain version in the manifest file,
and later modify and re-publish it with a different version (using the `publish` command instead of `upgrade`),
these are treated as different packages rather than versions of the same package on-chain.
Consequently, you cannot use one package as a dependency override for the other.
While you can specify such an override during the build process,
it will result in an error during publishing or upgrading on-chain.
