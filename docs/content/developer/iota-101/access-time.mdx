# Accessing On-Chain Time in IOTA

When you need to access network-based time for your transactions on IOTA, you have several options:

- **Near Real-Time Measurement**: Use the immutable reference of time provided by the [`Clock`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/clock.mdx) module in Move. This value updates with every network checkpoint.
- **Epoch Start Time**: Use the [`epoch_timestamp_ms`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/tx_context.mdx#function-epoch_timestamp_ms) function to capture the precise moment the current epoch started.

## Using the `iota::clock::Clock` Module

To access a prompt timestamp, you can pass a read-only reference of [`iota::clock::Clock`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/clock.mdx) as an entry function parameter in your transactions.
An instance of `Clock` is provided at the address `0x6`, and no new instances can be created.

Use the [`timestamp_ms`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/clock.mdx#function-timestamp_ms) function from the `iota::clock` module to extract a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.

```move file=<rootDir>/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework/sources/clock.move#L29-L33
```

### Example: Emitting an Event with a Timestamp

The following example demonstrates an entry function that emits an event containing a timestamp from the `Clock`:

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/basics/sources/clock.move#L5-L15
```

To call the previous entry function, pass `0x6` as the address for the `Clock` parameter:

```shell
iota client call --package <EXAMPLE> --module 'clock' --function 'access' --args '0x6'
```

**Note**: The `Clock` timestamp changes at the rate the network generates checkpoints, which is **every 1 second** with Narwhal/Bullshark consensus and **every 0.1 to 0.2 seconds** with Mysticeti consensus.

Successive calls to `iota::clock::timestamp_ms` within the same transaction will always produce the same result because transactions are considered to take effect instantly.
However, timestamps from `Clock` are monotonic across transactions that touch the same shared objects, meaning successive transactions see a greater or equal timestamp compared to their predecessors.

### Transaction Requirements

- **Consensus Requirement**: Any transaction that requires access to a `Clock` must go through consensus because the only available instance is a shared object.
- **Immutable Reference**: Transactions that use the clock must accept it as an **immutable reference** (`&Clock`), not as a mutable reference or value. This prevents contention, as transactions that access the `Clock` can only read it.

Validators will refuse to sign transactions that do not meet this requirement, and packages that include entry functions accepting a `Clock` or `&mut Clock` will fail to publish.

### Testing `Clock`-Dependent Code

The following functions allow you to test `Clock`-dependent code by manually creating a `Clock` object and manipulating its timestamp. This is possible only in test code:

```move file=<rootDir>/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework/sources/clock.move#L65-L93
```

Here's a basic test that creates a `Clock`, increments it, and then checks its value:

```move file=<rootDir>/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework/tests/clock_tests.move#L6-L22
```

## Using Epoch Timestamps

If you don't need a near real-time measurement,
you can use the [`epoch_timestamp_ms`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/tx_context.mdx#function-epoch_timestamp_ms) function 
from the [`iota::tx_context`](../../references/framework/iota-framework/tx_context.mdx) module to access the timestamp for the start of the
current epoch. This function works for all transactions, including those that do not go through consensus:

```move file=<rootDir>/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework/sources/tx_context.move#L54-L56
```

The function returns the point in time when the current epoch started, as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds (`u64`).
This value changes roughly **once every 24 hours** when the epoch changes.

### Testing Epoch-Sensitive Code

Tests based on [`iota::test_scenario`] can use `later_epoch` to exercise time-sensitive code that uses `epoch_timestamp_ms`:

```move file=<rootDir>/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework/sources/test/test_scenario.move#L141-L148
```

The `later_epoch` function behaves like `iota::test_scenario::next_epoch` (finishes the current transaction and epoch in the test scenario)
but also increments the timestamp by `delta_ms` milliseconds to simulate the passage of time.
