# Creating Loyalty Token

You can use the IOTA [Closed-Loop Token](../../standards/closed-loop-token.mdx) standard
to create [tokens](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/token.mdx) that are valid only within a specific service.
For example, an airline might grant tokens to frequent flyers that they can use to purchase tickets or upgrades.

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a loyalty token that users can use to make purchases in a digital gift shop.

## Overview

The following example demonstrates how to create a loyalty token using the Closed-Loop Token standard.
As the administrator, you would send `LOYALTY` tokens to your service's users as a reward for their loyalty.
The example includes a `GiftShop` where holders can spend `LOYALTY` tokens to buy `Gift` items.

## Module: `examples::loyalty`

The `examples::loyalty` module, found in the `loyalty.move` source file, contains the code to create the loyalty token.
The module defines a [one-time witness (OTW)](../move-overview/one-time-witness.mdx)
that creates the coin named `LOYALTY`.
This coin possesses only the `drop` ability and has no fields.
These characteristics ensure the `LOYALTY` type has a single instance.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/token/sources/loyalty.move#L22-L23
```

### Initialization Function

The module's [`init` function](../move-overview/init.mdx) uses the `LOYALTY` OTW to create the token.
Remember that all `init` functions run only once at the package publish event.
The initializer function calls [`create_currency`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#function-create_currency)
using the `LOYALTY` type defined earlier.
It also sets up a policy by sending both the [policy capability](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/token.mdx#resource-tokenpolicycap) 
and the [treasury capability](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-treasurycap) to the address associated with the publish event.
The holder of these transferable capabilities can mint new `LOYALTY` tokens and modify their policies.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/token/sources/loyalty.move#L37-L63
```

### Minting Function: `reward_user`

The `reward_user` function allows the holder of the `TreasuryCap` 
to mint new loyalty tokens and send them to specified addresses.
It uses the [`token::mint`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/token.mdx#function-mint) function
to create the tokens and [`token::transfer`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/token.mdx#function-transfer) to deliver them to the intended recipients.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/token/sources/loyalty.move#L71-L81
```

#### Redeeming Tokens: `buy_a_gift`

Finally, the module includes a `buy_a_gift` function to handle the redemption of `LOYALTY` tokens for `Gift` items.
This function ensures that the gift's price matches the number of loyalty tokens spent.
It uses the [`token::spend`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/token.mdx#function-spend) function to manage the treasury bookkeeping.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/token/sources/loyalty.move#L85-L100
```
