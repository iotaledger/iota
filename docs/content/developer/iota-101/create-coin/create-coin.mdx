# Creating Coins and Tokens

Coins and tokens in IOTA are similar concepts, often used interchangeably, 
but there are subtle differences in their implementation.
To understand these differences, refer to the standard documentation for [Closed-Loop Token](../../standards/closed-loop-token.mdx) and [Coin](../../standards/coin.mdx).

## Publishing a Coin

Publishing a coin on IOTA is almost as straightforward as publishing a new type. 
The key difference is the requirement of a [one-time witness](../move-overview/one-time-witness.mdx) when creating a coin.

```move file=<rootDir>/examples/move/coin/sources/my_coin.move 
```

The [`Coin<T>`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx) is a generic coin implementation in IOTA.
By accessing the [`TreasuryCap`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-treasurycap),
you gain control over minting and burning coins.
You can send further transactions directly to `iota::coin::Coin` using the `TreasuryCap` object for authorization.

## Extending the Coin Module

To extend the coin module, add a `mint` function.
This function utilizes the [`mint`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#function-mint) method from the `Coin` module
to create a coin and transfer it to a specified address.

## IOTA CLI

### Minting Coins

After publishing the coin module to the IOTA network,
you can mint coins and send them to an address using the `iota client call` command.
For more details on the command-line interface, see [IOTA CLI](../../../references/cli.mdx).

```shell
iota client call --function mint --module mycoin --package <PACKAGE-ID> --args <TREASURY-CAP-ID> <COIN-AMOUNT> <RECIPIENT-ADDRESS>
```

Upon successful execution, the console displays output including a **Balance Changes** section:

```shell
...

Owner: Account Address ( <RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> ) 
CoinType: <PACKAGE-ID>::mycoin::MYCOIN 
Amount: <COIN-AMOUNT>

...
```

## Implementing a Deny List

If you need to restrict specific addresses from accessing your coin, consider implementing a [`DenyList`](./regulated.mdx#managing-the-deny-list).

## Creating a Regulated Coin

To deny specific addresses from holding your coin,
use the [`create_regulated_currency`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#function-create_regulated_currency_v1) function instead of [`create_currency`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#function-create_currency).

Internally, `create_regulated_currency` calls `create_currency` to create the coin
and also produces a [`DenyCap`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-denycapv1) object.
This object allows you to manage the deny list in a `DenyList` object.
The process is similar to the previous example but includes transferring the `DenyCap` object to the module publisher.

## Creating Tokens

Tokens reuse the [`TreasuryCap`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-treasurycap) defined in the `iota::coin` module
and follow the same initialization process.
The `coin::create_currency` function ensures the uniqueness of the `TreasuryCap` and enforces the creation of a `CoinMetadata` object.

You can mint and burn tokens using functions similar to those for coins, both requiring the `TreasuryCap`:

- [`token::mint`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/token.mdx#function-mint) — Mint a token.
- [`token::burn`](../../../references/framework/iota-framework/token.mdx#function-burn) — Burn a token.

For complete details on working with tokens, refer to the [Closed-Loop Token](../../standards/closed-loop-token.mdx) standard.
