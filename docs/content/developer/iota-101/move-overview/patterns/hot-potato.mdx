# Hot Potato

The "hot potato" pattern in Move refers to a struct that lacks capabilities,
meaning it can only be created and used within its defining module. 

This pattern requires that function `B` must be called immediately after function `A`, when function `A` returns a hot potato and function `B` consumes it.
This approach is particularly useful in scenarios like implementing flash loans.

```

The [Flash Loan](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/main/examples/move/flash_lender/sources/example.move) example specifically illustrates the hot potato pattern described in this topic.
