# Move Coding Patterns

This section introduces various Move coding patterns designed to address specific logic challenges
you may encounter while developing packages for the IOTA blockchain.

## Capabilities

The [capability pattern](capabilities.mdx) allows for the authorization of actions on an object.

## Witness and Transferable Witness

A [witness](witness.mdx) and a [transferable witness](transferable-witness.mdx) are types with the `drop` ability 
that proves its owner was present during a privileged operation.
For example, having access to a one-time witness ([OTW](../one-time-witness.mdx))
for a module demonstrates that the code is being executed at the time the module was first published.

## Hot Potato

The [hot potato pattern](hot-potato.mdx) refers to a struct that lacks capabilities,
meaning it can only be packed and unpacked within its defining module.

## ID Pointer

Objects can reference each other by using their [IDs as pointers](id-pointer.mdx).
For example, 
a capability that controls access to another object might store that object's `ID` to perform authorization checks.
