# Capabilities

A capability is a design pattern that enables the authorization of specific actions with an object.
For instance,
the [`UpgradeCap`](../package-upgrades/upgrade.mdx#upgrade-requirements) is used to authorize the upgrading of packages.
Another common example is the [`TreasuryCap`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx#resource-treasurycap),
which grants the authority to manage treasury functions.
