# Witness Pattern

A witness is a type with the `drop` ability that serves as proof that its owner was present during a specific privileged operation.
For example, possessing a "one-time witness" for a module demonstrates that the code is being executed at the time of the module's initial publication.
The [`Coin`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/coin.mdx) module leverages this pattern to ensure that its treasury is created only once.
