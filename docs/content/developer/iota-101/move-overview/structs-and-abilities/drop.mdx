# Abilities: Drop

The `drop` ability - the simplest of abilities - allows the instance of a struct to be _ignored_ or
_discarded_. In many programming languages this behavior is considered default. However, in Move, a
struct without the `drop` ability is not allowed to be ignored. This is a safety feature of the Move
language, which ensures that all assets are properly handled. An attempt to ignore a struct without
the `drop` ability will result in a compilation error.

```


The `drop` ability is often used on custom collection types to eliminate the need for special
handling of the collection when it is no longer needed. For example, a `vector` type has the `drop`
ability, which allows the vector to be ignored when it is no longer needed. However, the biggest
feature of Move's type system is the ability to not have `drop`. This ensures that the assets are
properly handled and not ignored.

A struct with a single `drop` ability is called a _Witness_. We explain the concept of a _Witness_
in the [Witness and Abstract Implementation](../patterns/witness.mdx)
section.

## Types with the `drop` Ability

All native types in Move have the `drop` ability. This includes:

- bool
- unsigned integers
- [vector](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/vector.mdx)
- [address](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/address.mdx)

All of the types defined in the standard library have the `drop` ability as well. This includes:

- [Option](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/option.mdx)
- [String](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx)
- [TypeName](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/type_name.mdx)
