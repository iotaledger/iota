# Ability: Store

## Definition

The `store` is a special ability that allows a type to be _stored_ in objects. This ability is
required for the type to be used as a field in a struct that has the `key` ability. Another way to
put it is that the `store` ability allows the value to be _wrapped_ in an object.

:::info
The `store` ability also relaxes restrictions on transfer operations. We talk about it more in the
[Custome Transfer Rules](../../objects/transfers/custom-rules.mdx) section.

## Example

In previous sections we already used types with the `key` ability: all objects must have a `UID`
field, which we used in examples; we also used the `Storable` type as a part of the `Config` struct.
The `Config` type also has the `store` ability.

```move
/// This type has the `store` ability.
public struct Storable has store {}

/// Config contains a `Storable` field which must have the `store` ability.
public struct Config has key, store {
    id: UID,
    stores: Storable,
}

/// MegaConfig contains a `Config` field which has the `store` ability.
public struct MegaConfig has key {
    id: UID,
    config: Config, // there it is!
}
```

## Types with the `store` Ability

All native types (except for references) in Move have the `store` ability. This includes:

- bool
- unsigned integers
- [vector](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/vector.mdx)
- [address](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/address.mdx)

All of the types defined in the standard library have the `store` ability as well. This includes:

- [Option](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/option.mdx)
- [String](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx)
- [TypeName](../../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/type_name.mdx)
