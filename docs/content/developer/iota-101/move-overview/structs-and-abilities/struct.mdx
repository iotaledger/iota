# Custom Types with Struct

Move's type system offers the ability to define custom types. User defined types can be custom
tailored to the specific needs of the application. Not just on the data level, but also in its
behavior. In this section we introduce the struct definition and how to use it.

## Struct

To define a custom type, you can use the `struct` keyword followed by the name of the type. After
the name, you can define the fields of the struct. Each field is defined with the
`field_name: field_type` syntax. Field definitions must be separated by commas. The fields can be of
any type, including other structs.

:::info
Move does not support recursive structs, meaning a struct cannot contain itself as a field.
:::

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/struct.move#L10-L28
```


In the example above, we define a `Record` struct with five fields. The `title` field is of type
`String`, the `artist` field is of type `Artist`, the `year` field is of type `u16`, the `is_debut`
field is of type `bool`, and the `edition` field is of type `Option<u16>`. The `edition` field is of
type `Option<u16>` to represent that the edition is optional.

Structs are private by default, meaning they cannot be imported and used outside of the module they
are defined in. Their fields are also private and can't be accessed from outside the module. See
[visibility](../visibility.mdx) for more information on different visibility modifiers.

:::info
Fields of a struct are private and can only be accessed by the module defining the struct. Reading
and writing the fields of a struct in other modules is only possible if the module defining the
struct provides public functions to access the fields.
:::

## Create and Use an Instance

We described how struct _definition_ works. Now let's see how to initialize a struct and use it. A
struct can be initialized using the `struct_name { field1: value1, field2: value2, ... }` syntax.
The fields can be initialized in any order, and all of the fields must be set.

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/struct.move#L34-L36
```

In the example above, we create an instance of the `Artist` struct and set the `name` field to a
string "The Beatles".

To access the fields of a struct, you can use the `.` operator followed by the field name.

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/struct.move#L40-L50
```

Only module defining the struct can access its fields (both mutably and immutably). So the above
code should be in the same module as the `Artist` struct.


## Unpacking a Struct

Structs are non-discardable by default, meaning that the initiated struct value must be used: either
stored or _unpacked_. Unpacking a struct means deconstructing it into its fields. This is done using
the `let` keyword followed by the struct name and the field names.

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/struct.move#L54-L56
```

In the example above we unpack the `Artist` struct and create a new variable `name` with the value
of the `name` field. Because the variable is not used, the compiler will raise a warning. To
suppress the warning, you can use the underscore `_` to indicate that the variable is intentionally
unused.

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/struct.move#L64-L65
```
