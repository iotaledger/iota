# Managing Package Upgrades

In IOTA, smart contracts are represented as immutable package objects containing Move modules.
This immutability ensures that transactions can be executed quickly without requiring full consensus using [fast path transactions](../../../../about-iota/iota-architecture/transaction-lifecycle.mdx). If you could simply change these packages, they would become [shared objects](../../objects/object-ownership/shared.mdx)

However, this feature could be a limitation when developers need to iteratively update their code. 
Fortunately, the IOTA network allows you to upgrade packages while retaining their immutable characteristics.

## Key Considerations for Upgrading Packages

Before proceeding with a package upgrade, you should consider several factors to ensure a smooth transition:

### Module Initializers

[Module initializers (`init` functions)](../init.mdx) do not re-run during package upgrades. The `init` function is executed only once when the package is initially published. Subsequent upgrades will ignore any new `init` functions.

### Package Immutability

Since packages on IOTA are immutable, you cannot remove old versions from the chain.
Users can continue to interact with older versions of your package,
and as a developer, you need to account for this possibility.

## Handling Function Changes During Upgrades

Consider an example where your original package includes an `increment` function:

```move
public fun increment(c: &mut Counter) {
c.value = c.value + 1;
}
```

In a later upgrade, you add an event emission to this function:

```move
public struct Progress has copy, drop {
reached: u64
}

public fun increment(c: &mut Counter) {
c.value = c.value + 1;

    if (c.value % 100 == 0) {
        event::emit(Progress { reached: c.value });
    }
}
```

When both old and new versions of the `increment` function are called simultaneously, 
the process may fail because the old function is not aware of the `Progress` event added in the upgraded version.

## Addressing Compatibility Issues

:::tip Automated Address Management

IOTA supports [Automated Address Management](automated-address-management.mdx),
with which addresses will automatically be updated in the `Move.lock` file.

:::

When upgrading packages, you might encounter issues where dynamic fields need to stay synchronized with a struct’s original fields.
These issues can be mitigated by introducing a new type as part of the upgrade, effectively breaking backward compatibility and compelling users to update.

### Example: Upgrading with New Types

Suppose you're using owned objects to prove ownership, 
and you release a new version of your package to fix some code issues. 
You can introduce a new type in the upgraded package and create a function that swaps old objects for the new ones.
Since the logic in your package will only recognize the new type,
users will be required to update to the latest version.

### Example: Correcting Flawed Logic in Shared Objects

Consider a scenario where your package includes a shared object for bookkeeping, but you discover a flaw in its logic.
To ensure that users only interact with the corrected version,
you can add a new type and a migration function to your package upgrade.
This process typically involves two transactions:
one for the upgrade and another to set up the new shared object, which replaces the existing one.

To secure the setup function, you should create an `AdminCap` object or a similar mechanism to ensure that only you, the package owner, can initiate it. 
Additionally, you could implement a flag in the shared object that allows you to toggle its enabled state. 
This flag would prevent public access to the object during migration,
providing a safeguard while changes are being made.
It’s advisable to create such a flag if you anticipate needing to perform migrations in the future, rather than relying on intentionally flawed logic to need it.

### Managing Versioned Shared Objects

<AutomatedAddressManagement />

When dealing with shared objects within your packages, versioning and upgrade considerations become crucial as *all prior versions of a package still exist on-chain**. 
You can limit access to only the latest version of your package by introducing version tracking within your shared objects which can effectively safeguard your shared objects from being accessed from old versions of your package.

Here’s how you might implement a versioned `counter` module:

```move
module example::counter {

    public struct Counter has key {
        id: UID,
        value: u64,
    }

    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        transfer::share_object(Counter {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            value: 0,
        })
    }

    public fun increment(c: &mut Counter) {
        c.value = c.value + 1;
    }
}
```

To ensure that upgrades to your package can limit access to the shared object
, making sure it only interacts with the latest version, follow these steps:

#### 1. Track the Current Module Version

Define a constant, `VERSION`, in your module to represent the current version of the package.

#### 2. Track the Shared Object Version

Add a `version` field to your shared object (e.g., Counter) to keep track of its version.

#### 3. Introduce an `AdminCap` for Privileged Operations

Create an `AdminCap` to safeguard privileged actions, such as migrating the shared object.
Link the `Counter` object with its `AdminCap` using a new field.
If your package already has a similar type for shared object administration, you can reuse it.

#### 4. Guard Function Access

Ensure that all functions accessing the shared object verify that the object’s version matches the module’s `VERSION`.
This check prevents outdated versions from interacting with the latest package.

An upgrade-aware `counter` module that incorporates all these ideas looks as follows:

```move
module example::counter {

    // 1. Track the current version of the module
    const VERSION: u64 = 1;

    public struct Counter has key {
        id: UID,
        // 2. Track the current version of the shared object
        version: u64,
        // 3. Associate the `Counter` with its `AdminCap`
        admin: ID,
        value: u64,
    }

    public struct AdminCap has key {
        id: UID,
    }

    /// Calling functions from the wrong package version
    const EWrongVersion: u64 = 1;

    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let admin = AdminCap {
            id: object::new(ctx),
        };

        transfer::share_object(Counter {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            version: VERSION,
            admin: object::id(&admin),
            value: 0,
        });

        transfer::transfer(admin, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }

    public fun increment(c: &mut Counter) {
        // 4. Guard the entry of all functions that access the shared object
        //    with a version check.
        assert!(c.version == VERSION, EWrongVersion);
        c.value = c.value + 1;
    }
}
```

* The `VERSION` constant ensures that you have a reference to the current version of the package.
* The `version` field in Counter keeps the version information within the shared object itself, allowing functions to check against it.
* The `AdminCap` provides a mechanism to control and protect privileged operations, ensuring only authorized upgrades or migrations occur.
* The version check in functions guards each function to ensure it operates only on objects that match the current version, preventing older or incompatible objects from interacting with the latest package version.

To perform an upgrade, you need to:

1. Update the `VERSION` constant.
2. Implement a `migrate` function that updates the shared object's version.

Here’s an example of an upgraded `counter` module that not only emits `Progress` events,
but also includes tools for an `AdminCap` holder to manage access and prevent interactions with older package versions:

```move
module example::counter {
    use iota::event;

    // 1. Bump the `VERSION` of the package.
    const VERSION: u64 = 2;

    public struct Counter has key {
        id: UID,
        version: u64,
        admin: ID,
        value: u64,
    }

    public struct AdminCap has key {
        id: UID,
    }

    public struct Progress has copy, drop {
        reached: u64,
    }

    /// Not the right admin for this counter
    const ENotAdmin: u64 = 0;

    /// Migration is not an upgrade
    const ENotUpgrade: u64 = 1;

    /// Calling functions from the wrong package version
    const EWrongVersion: u64 = 2;

    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let admin = AdminCap {
            id: object::new(ctx),
        };

        transfer::share_object(Counter {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            version: VERSION,
            admin: object::id(&admin),
            value: 0,
        });

        transfer::transfer(admin, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }

    public fun increment(c: &mut Counter) {
        assert!(c.version == VERSION, EWrongVersion);
        c.value = c.value + 1;

        if (c.value % 100 == 0) {
            event::emit(Progress { reached: c.value })
        }
    }

    // 2. Introduce a migrate function
    entry fun migrate(c: &mut Counter, a: &AdminCap) {
        assert!(c.admin == object::id(a), ENotAdmin);
        assert!(c.version < VERSION, ENotUpgrade);
        c.version = VERSION;
    }
}
```

## Upgrading Packages

To upgrade to the latest version of your package, follow these steps:

1. **Perform the Package Upgrade**: Start by upgrading the package itself.
2. **Call the `migrate` Function**: After the upgrade, execute the `migrate` function in a separate transaction. This function is crucial for the migration process.

### The `migrate` Function

The `migrate` function plays a pivotal role in package upgrades:

#### Entry Function

It's designed as an `entry` function, not `public`, allowing for future changes or removal without restrictions.

#### Privileged Operation

The function requires an `AdminCap` and verifies that its ID matches the counter's ID being migrated.

#### Version Check

A sanity check ensures the module version is a true upgrade, preventing errors like missing version bumps.

Once the upgrade is complete, 
any attempts to call `increment` on the previous package version will fail due to the version check,
while calls on the updated version will proceed successfully.

### Extending the Migration Pattern

This migration pattern serves as a foundation for upgradeable packages with shared objects.
You can adapt it further depending on your package's specific needs:

#### Enhanced Version Constraints

Instead of a single `u64`, consider using a `String` or a combination of upper and lower bounds to specify versions.

#### Dynamic Access Control

Manage access to specific functions by adding or removing marker types as dynamic fields on the shared object.

#### Sophisticated Migrations

Modify other fields, adjust dynamic fields, or handle multiple shared objects during the migration process.


#### Large-Scale Migrations

For migrations requiring multiple transactions, consider a three-phase approach:

1. Disable access to the shared object by setting its version to a sentinel value, guarded by an `AdminCap`.
2. Execute the migration in batches over multiple transactions to avoid hitting transaction limits.
3. Reset the shared object's version to a usable value.

## Upgrade Requirements

Before you begin the upgrade, ensure your package meets these requirements:

- **Possess an `UpgradeTicket`**: You'll need an `UpgradeTicket` for the package you're upgrading. The IOTA network provides `UpgradeCaps` when you publish a package, and you can issue `UpgradeTickets` as the owner of that `UpgradeCap`. The IOTA Client CLI automates this process.
- **Maintain Layout Compatibility**: Your changes must be compatible with the previous version's layout:
    - Keep existing `public` function signatures unchanged.
    - Maintain the same struct layouts, including struct abilities.
    - You can add new structs and functions.
    - You can remove generic type constraints from existing functions.
    - Function implementations can be changed.
    - Non-`public` function signatures, including `friend` and `entry` functions, can be modified.

:::info

If your package has a dependency that is upgraded, your package will not automatically rely on the new version.
You'll need to upgrade your package explicitly to reference the updated dependency.

:::

## Upgrading

Use the `iota client upgrade` command to perform the package upgrade. Provide values for the following flags:

- `--gas-budget`: Specifies the maximum gas units allowed before the transaction is canceled.
- `--cap`: The ID of the `UpgradeCap`, which you receive as a return value from the publish command.

### Advanced Upgrade Policies

Developers working with Move can define custom upgrade policies using available types and functions.
For instance, you might want to prevent upgrades, regardless of the package owner.
The [`make_immutable` function](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#function-make_immutable) allows you 
to enforce this behavior.
For more complex policies, you can leverage types like [`UpgradeTicket`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#struct-upgradeticket) and [`UpgradeReceipt`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#struct-upgradereceipt).

### CLI-Driven Upgrade Process

When you use the IOTA Client CLI,
the `upgrade` command simplifies the [package](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx) upgrade process.
It generates the upgrade digest, authorizes the upgrade with the `UpgradeCap` to obtain an `UpgradeTicket`,
and updates the `UpgradeCap` with the `UpgradeReceipt` after a successful upgrade.

## Example: Upgrading an `iota_package`

<AutomatedAddressManagement />

Let's walk through an example of developing and upgrading a package named `iota_package`.
Initially, your manifest might look like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "iota_package"
version = "0.0.0"
edition = "2024.beta"

[addresses]
iota_package = "0x0"
```

### Publishing Your Package

Once your package is ready, you can publish it using the following command:

```shell
iota client publish --gas-budget <GAS-BUDGET-AMOUNT>
```

If successful, you'll receive a response similar to this:

```shell

### The Object Changes Section

The response includes an **Object changes** section,
which contains essential information for future upgrades,
including the `UpgradeCap` ID and your package ID.
You can identify these objects using the `Object.objectType` value:

* **UpgradeCap**: Identified by `String("0x2::package::UpgradeCap")`.
* **Package**: Identified by `String("<PACKAGE-ID>::iota_package::<MODULE-NAME>"`).

### Updating the Manifest

To make your package usable as a dependency for other packages, you should update the `Move.toml` manifest.
You need to adjust the alias address and add a `published-at` entry in the `[package]` section to reflect the on-chain ID:

```toml
[package]
name = "iota_package"
version = "0.0.0"
edition = "2024.beta"
published-at = "<ORIGINAL-PACKAGE-ID>"

[addresses]
iota_package = "<ORIGINAL-PACKAGE-ID>"
```

The `published-at` value in your manifest is crucial
as it allows the Move compiler to verify dependencies against the on-chain versions of those packages.

### Preparing for an Upgrade

After some time, you may decide to enhance your `iota_package` by adding new features.
Before executing the upgrade, you need to modify the package manifest:

1. **Update the Address**: In the `[addresses]` section, change the `iota_package` address value to `0x0`. This action prompts the validator to issue a new address for the upgraded package.
2. **Keep `published-at` Unchanged**: Since the `published-at` value is only referenced by the toolchain during the publishing of dependent packages, you can leave it as is.

Your updated manifest should look like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "iota_package"
version = "0.0.1"
edition = "2024.beta"
published-at = "<ORIGINAL-PACKAGE-ID>"

[addresses]
iota_package = "0x0"
```

### Executing the Upgrade

With the updated manifest and code prepared, you're ready to perform the upgrade.
Use the following command, passing the `UpgradeCap` ID using the `--upgrade-capability` flag:

```shell
iota client upgrade --gas-budget <GAS-BUDGET-AMOUNT> --upgrade-capability <UPGRADE-CAP-ID>
```

### Finalizing the Upgrade

The console will notify you if the new package fails to meet the upgrade requirements.
If everything checks out, the compiler will publish the upgraded package to the network and return the result.

With these steps, your `iota_package` will be successfully upgraded and ready for use with its new features.

After successfully upgrading your `iota_package`, the result will include a new ID for the upgraded package. Just like before, it's essential to update your manifest with this new ID. This ensures that any other packages depending on your `iota_package` can locate the correct on-chain bytecode for verification.

### Updating the Manifest

To reflect the new package ID, edit your manifest as follows:

1. **Update `published-at`**: Replace the existing `published-at` value with the new upgraded package ID.
2. **Restore the Original Address**: In the `[addresses]` section, return the `iota_package` value to the original package ID.

Your updated manifest should look like this:


```toml
[package]
name = "iota_package"
version = "0.0.1"
edition = "2024.beta"
published-at = "<UPGRADED-PACKAGE-ID>"

[addresses]
iota_package = "<ORIGINAL-PACKAGE-ID>"
```

* The `published-at` value will change with each upgrade to reflect the new package ID.
* The `iota_package` address in the `[addresses]` section should always point back to the original package ID after an upgrade.
* Before running any subsequent upgrade commands, always set the `iota_package` address to `0x0` in the `[addresses]` section. This ensures the validator assigns a new ID for the upgrade.
