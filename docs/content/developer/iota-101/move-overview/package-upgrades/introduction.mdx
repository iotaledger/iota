# Package Upgrades

A Move package consists of one or more modules that define how the package interacts with on-chain objects. 
These modules are written in Move, compiled into a package object, and then published on-chain.
Once a package is on the IOTA network,
its content and logic are transparent and accessible to anyone through an [IOTA network explorer](https://explorer.iota.cafe/).

## Packages Are Immutable

Once a package object is published on-chain, it becomes immutableâ€”it cannot be directly altered.
This immutability is crucial because other packages may rely on the modules provided by the original package.
If a developer could alter the logic of their on-chain package post-publication,
it could lead to unintended consequences for all dependent packages, potentially introducing bugs or vulnerabilities.

## Upgrading Packages

Although you can't modify an existing on-chain package, you can [upgrade](upgrade.mdx) it.
Upgrading a package involves creating a new package object on-chain, which includes the improved or additional code.
This approach ensures that the original package remains unchanged,
safeguarding the integrity of packages that depend on it. 

## Upgrading Packages with IOTA Client CLI

The [IOTA Client CLI](../../../../references/cli/client.mdx) provides an [`upgrade` command](../../../../references/cli/client.mdx#commands),
which is a straightforward way to upgrade packages.
To use this command, the CLI's active address must own the [`UpgradeCap`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx) object
associated with the package you wish to upgrade.

While the IOTA CLI is convenient for initiating upgrades, especially during the early stages of development,
relying on a single key to manage upgrades can introduce significant security risks:

<UpgradeSingleKeyRisk />

## Making Packages Truly Immutable

To eliminate the risks associated with single-key control, you can make your package _immutable_ after it is published.
You can do this with the [`iota::package::make_immutable`](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/package.mdx#function-make_immutable) function,
which destroys the `UpgradeCap` associated with the package, preventing any future upgrades.
However, making a package immutable also means that you lose the ability to fix bugs or introduce new features,
so it should be done with caution.

For more secure and flexible upgrade management,
consider implementing [Custom Upgrade Policies](custom-policies.mdx) that reduce the risks
without completely sacrificing the ability to upgrade.
