# Strings

While Move does not have a built-in type to represent strings, it does offer two standard implementations for strings:

* The [`std::string`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx) module defines a `String` type and methods for working with UTF-8 encoded strings.
* The [`std::ascii`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/ascii.mdx) module provides an ASCII `String` type along with its methods.

:::tip

The IOTA execution environment automatically converts byte vectors into `String` types in transaction inputs. Therefore, in many cases, you don't need to manually construct a `String` in the [Transaction Block](./../transactions/transactions.mdx).

## Strings Are Bytes

Regardless of the string type you choose, it's important to understand that strings are fundamentally just bytes. The `string` and `ascii` modules provide wrappers for these bytes, offering safety checks and methods to work with strings. However, at the core, they remain vectors of bytes.

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/string.move#L5-L20
```

## Working with UTF-8 Strings

Although the standard library includes two types of strings, the `string` module should generally be considered the default choice. It includes native implementations of many common operations, making it more efficient than the `ascii` module, which is fully implemented in Move.

### Definition

The `String` type in the `std::string` module is defined as follows:


```move file=<rootDir>/crates/iota-framework/packages/move-stdlib/sources/string.move#L18-L20
```


### Creating a String

To create a new UTF-8 `String` instance, you can use the `string::utf8` method.


```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/string.move#L49-L57
```

### Common Operations

The UTF-8 `String` type provides several methods to work with strings. The most common operations include:

* [`append`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx#function-append).
* [`append_utf8`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx#function-append_utf8).
* [`substring`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx#function-sub_string).
* [`length`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx#function-length).
* [`is_empty`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx#function-is_empty).

Additionally, for custom string operations, the `as_bytes()` method can be used to access the underlying byte vector.

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/string.move#L81-L97
```

### Safe UTF-8 Operations

The default `utf8` method may abort if the bytes passed into it are not valid UTF-8. If you're unsure whether the bytes are valid, you should use the [`try_utf8`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/string.mdx#function-try_utf8) method instead. It returns an [`Option<String>`](../../../references/framework/move-stdlib/option.mdx#0x1_option_Option), which contains no value if the bytes are not valid UTF-8, and a `String` otherwise.

:::tip Try

Functions that start with `try_*` typically return an `Option` with the expected result or `none` if the operation fails. This naming convention is borrowed from Rust.

```move file=<rootDir>/docs/examples/move/move-overview/string.move#L65-L72
```

### UTF-8 Limitations

The `string` module does not provide a way to access individual characters in a string. This limitation arises because UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, and the length of a character can range from 1 to 4 bytes. Similarly, the `length()` method returns the number of bytes in the string, not the number of characters.

However, methods like `sub_string` and `insert` ensure character boundaries are respected and will abort if the index is in the middle of a character.
