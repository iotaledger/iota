title: Capabilities

A capability is a pattern that allows authorizing actions with an object. For example, the [`UpgradeCap`](../packages/upgrade.mdx#upgrade-requirements) authorizes the action of upgrading packages. One of the most common capabilities you might encounter is `TreasuryCap`, which is defined in [`iota::coin`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-framework/sources/coin.move).


```move
module examples::item {
    use iota::transfer;
    use iota::object::{Self, UID};
    use std::string::{Self, String};
    use iota::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

    /// Type that marks Capability to create new `Item`s.
    public struct AdminCap has key { id: UID }

    /// Custom NFT-like type.
    public struct Item has key, store { id: UID, name: String }

    /// Module initializer is called once on module publish.
    /// Here we create only one instance of `AdminCap` and send it to the publisher.
    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        transfer::transfer(AdminCap {
            id: object::new(ctx)
        }, tx_context::sender(ctx))
    }

    /// The entry function can not be called if `AdminCap` is not passed as
```
