# Use Sponsored Transactions

[Sponsored transactions](about-sponsored-transactions.mdx) in IOTA enable one address (the sponsor) to pay the gas fees for a [transaction](../transactions.mdx) initiated by another address (the user).

You can leverage IOTA sponsored transactions to:

- **Sponsor user-initiated transactions**: Pay the gas fees for transactions that users initiate.
- **Sponsor your own transactions**: Cover the gas fees for transactions you start.
- **Provide a wildcard `GasData` object**: Offer users a `GasData` object that covers gas fees for their transactions, as long as the budget is sufficient.


:::danger Risks of Sponsored Transactions

While sponsored transactions offer significant benefits, they come with [potential risks](about-sponsored-transactions.mdx#client-equivocation-risk), the most notable being [equivocation](/references/iota-glossary.mdx#equivocation). Under certain conditions, a sponsored transaction can cause all associated owned objects, including gas, to become locked when processed by IOTA validators.

## User-Initiated Sponsored Transaction Flow

To set up a user-initiated sponsored transaction, follow these steps:

1. **User creates a `GasLessTransactionData` transaction**: The user initializes a transaction without gas data.
2. **User sends `GasLessTransactionData` to the sponsor**: The user forwards the transaction data to the sponsor.
3. **Sponsor validates and signs**: The sponsor reviews the transaction, constructs `TransactionData` with gas fees, and signs it.
4. **Sponsor returns signed transaction**: The sponsor sends the signed `TransactionData` and their `Signature` back to the user.
5. **User verifies and signs**: The user verifies the transaction, signs the `TransactionData`, and submits the dual-signed transaction to the IOTA network via a full node or through the sponsor.

### Understanding `GasLessTransactionData`

`GasLessTransactionData` is essentially a `TransactionData` structure without the `GasData` field. It is not an official `iota-core` data structure but serves as an interface between the user and the sponsor.

Here is an example of how a `GasLessTransactionData` object might be constructed:

```rust
pub struct GasLessTransactionData {
pub kind: TransactionKind,
sender: IotaAddress,
â€¦
}
```

## IOTA Gas Station

An IOTA gas station is a concept where you set up processes to sponsor user transactions.
You can customize a gas station to provide specific functionalities based on your needs. Some examples include:

- **Monitoring gas prices**: Keep track of real-time gas prices on the network to determine the gas price offered.
- **Tracking gas usage**: Monitor how the gas provided to users is utilized on the network.
- **Managing gas pools**: Use specific gas objects to minimize costs or reduce the risk of having a large number of locked objects that remain illiquid while locked.

### Implement Authorization and Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse, you can implement various authorization rules:

- **Rate limiting**: Limit gas requests per account or IP address.
- **Authentication**: Accept requests only with a valid authorization header, each having separate rate limits.

### Detect and Prevent Abuse

Monitor all gas objects provided as a sponsor to detect if users attempt to equivocate or lock objects. If such behavior is detected, block the user or requester accordingly.

### Code Examples for Creating an IOTA Gas Station

The following Rust SDK code examples demonstrate how to implement an IOTA gas station that supports the various types of sponsored transactions discussed earlier.

#### User-Initiated Sponsored Transactions

Use the API endpoint to receive `GaslessTransaction` transactions and return a sole-signed `SenderSignedData` object:

```rust
pub fn request_gas_and_signature(gasless_tx: GaslessTransaction) -> Result<SenderSignedData, Error>;
```

#### Sponsored Transactions with `GasData` Objects

Use the API endpoint to receive a sole-signed `SenderSignedData` and return the result of the transaction:

```rust
pub fn submit_sole_signed_transaction(sole_signed_data: SenderSignedData) -> Result<(Transaction, CertifiedTransactionEffects), Error>;
```

Alternatively, provide a `GasData` object via an API endpoint:

```rust
pub fn request_gas(/*requirement data*/) -> Result<GasData, Error>;
```

#### Sponsor-Initiated Transactions

Use the API endpoint to receive dual-signed `SenderSignedData` and return the transaction result:

```rust
pub fn submit_dual_signed_transaction(dual_signed_data: SenderSignedData) -> Result<(Transaction, CertifiedTransactionEffects), Error>;
```

For user and sponsor-initiated transactions, users can submit the dual-signed transaction either through the sponsor or directly to a full node.

#### Data Structures for Sponsored Transactions

The following code blocks describe the `TransactionData` structure for sponsored transactions and the `GasData` structure. You can view the [source code](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/crates/iota-types/src/messages.rs) in the IOTA GitHub repository.

##### `TransactionData` Structure

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct TransactionDataV1 {
pub kind: TransactionKind,
pub sender: IotaAddress,
pub gas_data: GasData,
pub expiration: TransactionExpiration,
}
```

##### `GasData` Structure

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct GasData {
pub payment: Vec<ObjectRef>,
pub owner: IOTAAddress,
pub price: u64,
pub budget: u64,
}
```
