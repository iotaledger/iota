# Build Programmable Transaction Blocks with TypeScript SDK

This guide illustrates how to build a [programmable transaction block (PTB)](programmable-transaction-blocks.mdx) on IOTA
using the [TypeScript SDK](../../../../references/ts-sdk/typescript/install.mdx). 

This example starts by building a PTB to send IOTA tokens.
To construct transactions, import the `Transaction` class and create a new instance:

```ts
import { Transaction } from "@iota/iota-sdk";
const txb = new Transaction();
```

With this instance, you can add transactions to the PTB:

```ts
// Generate a new coin with a balance of 100, derived from the coins used for gas payment.
// You can specify any balance here.
const [coin] = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [txb.pure(100)]);

// Transfer the newly created coin to a specific address.
txb.transferObjects([coin], txb.pure("0xSomeIOTAAddress"));
```

You can also attach multiple transaction commands of the same type to a PTB.
For instance, to process a list of transfers and send coins to each recipient:

```ts
interface Transfer {
  to: string;
  amount: number;
}

// Obtain a list of IOTA transfers to execute:
const transfers: Transfer[] = getTransfers();

const txb = new Transaction();

// First, split the gas coin into multiple coins:
const coins = txb.splitCoins(
  txb.gas,
  transfers.map((transfer) => txb.pure(transfer.amount))
);

// Then, create a transfer transaction for each coin:
transfers.forEach((transfer, index) => {
  txb.transferObjects([coins[index]], txb.pure(transfer.to));
});
```

After defining the PTB, you can execute it directly with a `signer` using `signAndExecuteTransaction`:

```ts
signer.signAndExecuteTransaction({ Transaction: txb });
```

## Defining Inputs

Inputs allow you to provide external values to PTBs,
such as specifying the amount of IOTA to transfer or passing objects into a Move call.

There are two primary ways to define inputs:

- For objects: use the `txb.object(objectId)` function to construct an input containing an object reference.
- For pure values: use the `txb.pure(value, type?)` function to create an input for non-object values.
  - If the value is a `Uint8Array`, it's treated as raw bytes and used directly.
  - If a type is provided, it's used to generate the BCS serialization layout for the value. If not, the type is automatically determined based on the value.

## Available Transaction Commands

IOTA supports the following transaction commands:

### `txb.splitCoins(coin, amounts)`
Creates new coins with specified amounts, split from the provided coin. Returns the coins for use in subsequent transactions.

#### Example

`txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [txb.pure(100), txb.pure(200)])`

### `txb.mergeCoins(destinationCoin, sourceCoins)`

Merges the `sourceCoins` into the `destinationCoin`.

#### Example

`txb.mergeCoins(txb.object(coin1), [txb.object(coin2), txb.object(coin3)])`

### `txb.transferObjects(objects, address)`

Transfer a list of objects to the specified address.

#### Example

`txb.transferObjects([txb.object(thing1), txb.object(thing2)], txb.pure(myAddress))`

### `txb.moveCall({ target, arguments, typeArguments })`

Executes a Move call and returns whatever the IOTA Move call returns.

#### Example

`txb.moveCall({ target: '0x2::devnet_nft::mint', arguments: [txb.pure(name), txb.pure(description), txb.pure(image)] })`

### `txb.makeMoveVec({ type, elements })`

Constructs a vector of objects that can be passed into a `moveCall`. This is required since there's no other way to define a vector as an input.

#### Example

`txb.makeMoveVec({ elements: [txb.object(id1), txb.object(id2)] })`

### `txb.publish(modules, dependencies)`

Publishes a Move package and returns the upgrade capability object.

## Using Transaction Results as Arguments

You can pass the result of a transaction command as an argument in subsequent commands.
Each transaction command method on the transaction builder returns a reference to the transaction result.

```ts
// Split a coin object from the gas object:
const [coin] = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [txb.pure(100)]);
// Transfer the resulting coin object:
txb.transferObjects([coin], txb.pure(address));
```

When a transaction command returns multiple results,
you can access a specific result using destructuring or array indices.

```ts
// Using destructuring (preferred for logical naming):
const [nft1, nft2] = txb.moveCall({ target: "0x2::nft::mint_many" });
txb.transferObjects([nft1, nft2], txb.pure(address));

// Using array indices:
const mintMany = txb.moveCall({ target: "0x2::nft::mint_many" });
txb.transferObjects([mintMany[0], mintMany[1]], txb.pure(address));
```

## Using the Gas Coin

With PTBs, you can use the gas payment coin to create coins with a specific balance using [`splitCoin`](programmable-transaction-blocks.mdx#splitcoins).
This is useful for IOTA payments and eliminates the need for upfront coin selection. 
You can access the gas coin in a PTB using `txb.gas`, and it's valid as input for any arguments.
However, with `transferObjects`, `txb.gas` must be used by reference.
Practically, this means you can add to the gas coin with `mergeCoins` or borrow it for Move functions with `moveCall`.

You can also transfer the gas coin using `transferObjects` if you wish to transfer your entire coin balance to another address.

## Obtaining PTB Bytes

If you need the PTB bytes instead of signing or executing it, you can use the `build` method on the transaction builder.

:::tip

You might need to explicitly call `setSender()` on the PTB to ensure the `sender` field is populated. This is usually done by the signer before signing the transaction but won't happen automatically if you're building the PTB bytes yourself.

:::

```ts
const txb = new Transaction();

// ... add some transactions...

await txb.build({ provider });
```

In most cases, building requires your JSON RPC provider to fully resolve input values.

If you have PTB bytes, you can also convert them back into a `Transaction` class:

```ts
const bytes = getTransactionBytesFromSomewhere();
const txb = Transaction.from(bytes);
```

## Building Offline

If you want to build a PTB offline (without a `provider`), you need to fully define all your input values and gas configuration (see the example below). For pure values, you can provide a `Uint8Array` which is used directly in the transaction. For objects, you can use the `Inputs` helper to construct an object reference.

```ts
import { Inputs } from "@iota/iota-sdk/transactions";

// For pure values:
txb.pure(pureValueAsBytes);

// For owned or immutable objects:
txb.object(Inputs.ObjectRef({ digest, objectId, version }));

// For shared objects:
txb.object(Inputs.SharedObjectRef({ objectId, initialSharedVersion, mutable }));
```

You can then omit the `provider` object when calling `build` on the transaction. If any required data is missing, this will throw an error.

## Configuring Gas Settings

The transaction builder comes with default behavior for gas logic, including automatically setting the gas price, budget, and selecting coins for gas payment. This behavior can be customized.

### Setting Gas Price

By default, the gas price is set to the network's reference gas price. You can explicitly set the gas price of the PTB by calling `setGasPrice` on the transaction builder.

```ts
txb.setGasPrice(gasPrice);
```

### Setting Gas Budget

By default, the gas budget is automatically derived by executing a dry run of the PTB beforehand. The dry run's gas consumption is then used to determine a balance for the transaction. You can override this behavior by explicitly setting a gas budget for the transaction using `setGasBudget`.

:::info

The gas budget is represented in IOTA and should consider the PTB's gas price.

:::

```ts
txb.setGasBudget(gasBudgetAmount);
```

### Specifying Gas Payment

By default, the gas payment is automatically determined by the SDK,
selecting all coins at the provided address that are not used as inputs in the PTB.

[The selected coins will be merged into a single gas coin before executing the PTB](optimizing-gas-with-coin-merging.mdx),
and all but one of the gas objects will be deleted. The gas coin at index 0 will be the coin into which all others are merged.

```ts
// Ensure that the coins do not overlap with any input objects for the PTB.
txb.setGasPayment([coin1, coin2]);
```

### Integrating with dApps and Wallets

The Wallet Standard interface now supports the `Transaction` kind directly. All `signTransaction` and `signAndExecuteTransaction` calls from dApps to wallets are expected to provide a `Transaction` class. This PTB class can then be serialized and sent to your wallet for execution.

To serialize a PTB for sending to a wallet, it's recommended to use the `txb.serialize()` function,
which returns an opaque string representation of the PTB
that can be passed from the wallet standard dApp context to your wallet.
This can then be converted back into a `Transaction` using `Transaction.from()`.

:::tip

You should not build the PTB from bytes in the dApp code.
Using `serialize` instead of `build` allows you to build the PTB bytes within the wallet itself,
enabling the wallet to perform gas logic and coin selection as needed.

:::

```ts
// Within a dApp
const tx = new Transaction();
wallet.signTransaction({ Transaction: tx });

// Wallet standard code:
function handleSignTransaction(input) {
  sendToWalletContext({ Transaction: input.Transaction.serialize() });
}

// Within your wallet context:
function handleSignRequest(input) {
  const userTx = Transaction.from(input.transaction);
}
```

## Creating Sponsored PTBs

The PTB builder supports sponsored PTBs by using the `onlyTransactionKind` flag when building the PTB.

```ts
const txb = new Transaction();
// ... add some transactions...

const kindBytes = await txb.build({ provider, onlyTransactionKind: true });

// Construct a sponsored transaction from the kind bytes:
const sponsoredTxb = Transaction.fromKind(kindBytes);

// Set the necessary sponsored transaction data:
sponsoredTxb.setSender(sender);
sponsoredTxb.setGasOwner(sponsor);
sponsoredTxb.setGasPayment(sponsorCoins);
```
