# Managing Owned Coins in IOTA

In IOTA programming, effectively managing owned coins is essential for seamless transaction execution.
This guide explores the concept of [owned objects](../../objects/object-ownership/address-owned.mdx),
how they differ from traditional account balances, and best practices for coin management in IOTA.

## Understanding Owned Objects

IOTA introduces the concept of [address-owned objects](../../objects/object-ownership/address-owned.mdx,
which allows for highly parallelizable transactions and logically maps to assets exclusively owned by an individual. 
Coins in IOTA are examples of these owned objects, similar to holding cash rather than maintaining a bank balance.

Unlike other blockchains that use a single balance per account,
IOTA's approach means you might own multiple coins as separate objects .
This paradigm shift requires a different strategy for managing your assets.

## The Importance of Coin Management

Owning multiple coins means you may need to merge them to meet the value required for certain transactions.
[Merging coins](#coin-merging-overview) becomes necessary when the amount needed exceeds any single coin you possess,
making coin management a crucial step in transaction preparation.

## Using the IOTA SDKs

The IOTA SDKs for [TypeScript](../../../../references/ts-sdk/typescript/index.mdx) and [Rust](../../../../references/rust-sdk.mdx) handle coin management automatically,
merging coins as needed and assuming sequential transaction execution.
This automation simplifies the process for most use cases where high concurrency isn't a concern.

## Coin Merging Overview

IOTA allows you to provide multiple coins as payment in a transaction.
This feature, known as [coin merging](optimizing-gas-with-coin-merging.mdx),
automatically combines these coins into one,
presenting your [programmable transaction blocks (PTBs)](programmable-transaction-blocks) with a single gas coin 
usable for various purposes beyond just paying for gas.

You can supply numerous coins (up to a protocol-defined limit), which are merged into the first coin provided.
After deducting the gas budget, the remaining amount is available within the transaction and returned if unused.

## Managing Generic Coins

While coin merging works seamlessly for `Coin<IOTA>` objects used for gas payments,
other coin types require manual management.
PTBs offer commands like [`mergeCoins`](programmable-transaction-blocks#mergecoins) to combine multiple coins,
and [`splitCoins`](programmable-transaction-blocks#splitcoins) to divide them, giving you control over your coin distribution.

These operations are cost-effective but necessitate awareness of your specific needs and coin holdings.

## Addressing Concurrency Challenges

When high concurrency is required, merging all your `Coin<IOTA>` into a single coin can create bottlenecks.
Since each coin is an owned object, it's locked during a transaction, preventing simultaneous use in other transactions.
Attempting to use the same coin concurrently can lead to conflicts and render the coin unusable until the epoch ends.

To enable concurrent transactions,
consider splitting a coin into multiple coins corresponding to the number of transactions,
or using different coins for each transaction without overlap.

Concurrency introduces additional complexities,
such as performance impacts from multiple network interactions with full nodes during transaction creation and submission.
Careful planning is essential, and strategies should be tailored to your specific scenarios.
