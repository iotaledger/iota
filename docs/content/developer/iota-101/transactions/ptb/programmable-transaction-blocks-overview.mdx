# Programmable Transaction Blocks Overview

[Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs)](programmable-transaction-blocks) are fundamental elements within the IOTA ecosystem. Understanding how to effectively use PTBs is crucial for developing efficient and cost-effective smart contracts.

## Building PTBs with the TypeScript SDK

To truly harness the capabilities of PTBs, practical experience is key. Utilizing tools like the [IOTA TypeScript SDK](../../../../references/ts-sdk/typescript/index.mdx) allows you to explore the power and flexibility that PTBs offer.

Dive deeper into this topic in [Building Programmable Transaction Blocks](building-programmable-transaction-blocks-ts-sdk).

## Navigating Coin Management

In IOTA, `Coin` objects are distinct because they are [owned objects](../../objects/object-ownership/address-owned.mdx), setting them apart from coins on other blockchains. Whether you're handling IOTA for gas payments or managing generic coins, a solid grasp of coin management is essential. Smart contracts typically use standard patterns to accept coins, so your PTBs must interact correctly with these contracts to facilitate successful transactions.

## Simulating References with the Borrow Module

The [`borrow` module](../../../../references/framework/iota-framework/borrow.mdx) in the IOTA framework offers valuable features for working with objects by reference within your PTBs.

Learn how to implement these features in [Simulating References](simulating-references.mdx).
