# Network Overview

This pages gives an overview around the different networks available in the IOTA ecosystem.


:::info
In general, all endpoints are load-balanced but also subject to rate limiting. If you are developing a production-level application for IOTA, consider [setting up your own infrastructure](/developer/getting-started/local-network) to have more control and avoid any limits.
:::

## IOTA Mainnet

<MainnetRunsStardust />

## IOTA Testnet

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_move_testnet']}/>

## IOTA Devnet

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_move_devnet']}/>

## IOTA Localnet

To create a local IOTA network, you can refer to [Local Development](/developer/getting-started/local-network) page.

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_localnet']}/>
