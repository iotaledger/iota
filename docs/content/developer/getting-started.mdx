IOTA is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform. That might read like marketing speak, but as you peruse the documentation to understand the technology, you will discover that IOTA addresses many of the problems that hold blockchains back from mass adoption. 

Before you can get started developing on IOTA, you need to understand the code repository and install its binaries. Consequently, the first two topics you need are:

- [IOTA Environment Setup](getting-started/iota-environment.mdx)
- [Install IOTA](getting-started/iota-install.mdx)

## After installing IOTA

After you have IOTA installed on your system, you can begin to connect with a network and publish smart contracts. 

- [Connect to a IOTA Network](getting-started/connect.mdx)
- [Connect to a Local Network](getting-started/local-network.mdx)
- [Get IOTA Address](getting-started/get-address.mdx)
- [Get IOTA Coins](getting-started/get-coins.mdx)

## GraphQL queries

Use the GraphQL service for IOTA RPC to interact with on-chain data. 

Go to [Query IOTA RPC with GraphQL](getting-started/graphql-rpc.mdx).

After installing IOTA and setting up your development environment, use the information in the following sections to continue your development journey.

- [IOTA 101](iota-101.mdx): Topics that you should know when just starting out to develop on IOTA.
- [Advanced Topics](advanced.mdx): Topics that you might not find beneficial until you start solving more complex problems.
- [Cryptography](cryptography/how-to/cryptography.mdx): Leverage cryptography functions to provide security for your smart contract actions.
