### Validator staking pool requirements 

There are minimum staking requirements a validator must satisfy to become active and to stay in the active validator set.

More precisely:

- A validator candidate must accrue at least 30M IOTA of stake before they can request to join the validator set.
- If an active validator’s stake falls below 20M IOTA, they have seven epochs of grace period to gain back the stake before being removed from the validator set.
- If an active validator’s stake falls below 15M IOTA, they are removed from the validator set at the end of the current epoch boundary. Iota uses 24-hour epochs.
