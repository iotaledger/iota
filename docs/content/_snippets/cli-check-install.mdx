## Check Iota CLI installation

Before you can use the Iota CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```shell
iota --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the Iota CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [Install Iota](/guides/developer/getting-started/iota-install.mdx) to get the Iota CLI on your system.
