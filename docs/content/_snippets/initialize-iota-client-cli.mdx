See [Publish a Package](../developer/getting-started/publish.mdx) for a more detailed guide on publishing packages or [IOTA Client CLI](/references/cli/client.mdx) for a complete reference of `client` commands in the IOTA CLI.

:::

Before publishing your code, you must first initialize the IOTA Client CLI, if you haven't already. To do so, in a terminal or console at the root directory of the project enter `iota client`. If you receive the following response, complete the remaining instructions:

```
Config file ["<FILE-PATH>/.iota/iota_config/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a IOTA full node server [y/N]?
```

Enter `y` to proceed. You receive the following response:

```
IOTA full node server URL (Defaults to IOTA Devnet if not specified) :
```

Leave this blank (press Enter). You receive the following response:

```
Select key scheme to generate keypair (0 for ed25519, 1 for secp256k1, 2: for secp256r1):
```

Select `0`. Now you should have a IOTA address set up.
