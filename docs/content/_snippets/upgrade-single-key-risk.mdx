- **Conflicting Interests:** The entity controlling the key may make changes that benefit themselves but are not in the best interests of the broader community.
- **Lack of Consultation:** Upgrades might be executed without sufficient time for package users to review the changes or decide whether to continue using the package if they disagree with the updates.
- **Key Loss:** If the key is lost, it could permanently prevent any future upgrades, leaving the package in a potentially vulnerable or outdated state.
