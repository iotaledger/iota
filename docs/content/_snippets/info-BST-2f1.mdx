In Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) `f` is used to represent the amount of faulty validators. `2f+1` represents the minimum number of validators
needed to agree on a transaction to ensure integrity and finality, even if up to `f` validators are faulty.

For example, if `f = 1`, this means 3 validators must confirm a transaction (a supermajority) to guarantee its
integrity,
ensuring that even if one validator is faulty, the correct decision still stands.
