# Iota Owned Object Pools Quick Start

<Beta/>

IotaOOP is a TypeScript library that provides a set of tools for managing multiple concurrent
transactions on the Iota network to help avoid object equivocation and locking.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i iotaoop
```

## Usage

At a high level, this is how you implement the library:

```ts
// Initialize the ExecutorServiceHandler.
const eshandler = await ExecutorServiceHandler.initialize(adminKeypair, iotaClient);

/// And then for each incoming request...
/// ...get the incoming transactionBlock
const myTransactionBlock;

/// and send it for execution
const promise = eshandler.execute(myTransactionBlock, iotaClient, splitStrategy);
```

See [End-to-End Examples](../owned-object-pool/examples.mdx) for sample code you can run.
