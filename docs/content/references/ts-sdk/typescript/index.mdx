# IOTA TypeScript SDK Quick Start

The IOTA TypeScript SDK is a modular library of tools for interacting with the IOTA blockchain. Use it
to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and interact with a IOTA or local network.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @iota/iota-sdk
```

## Network locations

The following table lists the locations for IOTA networks.

{ /* TODO: Shhould be moved to mainnet once it is live */ }
<HighTrafficRpcs />

## IOTA Testnet

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_move_testnet']}/>

## IOTA Devnet

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_move_devnet']}/>

## IOTA Localnet

To create a local IOTA network, you can refer to [Local Development](/developer/getting-started/local-network) page.

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_localnet']}/>

## Migrate to version 0.38.0

The IOTA TypeScript SDK was refactored beginning with version 0.38.0. If you are updating from an
earlier version of the SDK, there are some changes you should consider when updating your code.

### Module structure

The IOTA TypeScript SDK is now divided into modular components. Before version 0.38.0, you imported
the complete SDK module. Now, you upload the individual packages of the SDK module instead. See the
[Module Packages section](#module-packages) for the list of packages.

### Signing transactions

Signing and sending transactions changes slightly with the deprecation of the `Signer`
pattern. For an example of transaction signing, see the
[IOTA Programmable Transaction Blocks Basics](./transaction-building/basics.mdx) topic.

### Faucet requests

The ability to request IOTA from a faucet is not part of `IotaClient` as it was with
`JsonRpcProvider`. Instead, you must use the `requestIotaFromFaucetV0` method from
`@iota/iota-sdk/faucet`. The `@iota/iota-sdk/faucet` import also provides a `getFaucetHost` method
to retrieve the faucet URL for `localnet`, `testnet`, or `devnet` networks.

```ts
import { getFaucetHost, requestIotaFromFaucetV0 } from '@iota/iota-sdk/faucet';

await requestIotaFromFaucetV0({
    host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
    recipient: '<IOTA_ADDRESS>',
});
```

## Module packages

The SDK contains a set of modular packages that you can use independently or together. Import just
what you need to keep your code light and compact.

-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/client`](./iota-client.mdx) - A client for interacting with IOTA RPC nodes.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/bcs`](bcs.mdx) - A BCS builder with pre-defined types for IOTA.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/transaction`](./transaction-building/basics.mdx) - Utilities for building
    and interacting with transactions.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/keypairs/*`](./cryptography/keypairs.mdx) - Modular exports for specific
    KeyPair implementations.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/verify`](./cryptography/keypairs.mdx#verifying-signatures-without-a-key-pair) -
    Methods for verifying transactions and messages.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/cryptography`](./cryptography/keypairs.mdx) - Shared types and classes
    for cryptography.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/multisig`](./cryptography/multisig.mdx) - Utilities for working with
    multisig signatures.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/utils`](./utils.mdx) - Utilities for formatting and parsing various IOTA
    types.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/faucet`](./faucet.mdx) - Methods for requesting IOTA from a faucet.
