# IOTA TypeScript SDK Quick Start

The IOTA TypeScript SDK is a modular library of tools for interacting with the IOTA blockchain. Use it
to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and interact with a IOTA or local network.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @iota/iota-sdk
```

## Network locations

The following table lists the locations for IOTA networks.

{ /* TODO: https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/issues/4497 */ }
<HighTrafficRpcs />

## IOTA Testnet

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_move_testnet']}/>

## IOTA Devnet

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_move_devnet']}/>

## IOTA Localnet

To create a local IOTA network, you can refer to [Local Development](/developer/getting-started/local-network) page.

<NetworkInfo.Move {...Networks['iota_localnet']}/>

## Module packages

The SDK contains a set of modular packages that you can use independently or together. Import just
what you need to keep your code light and compact.

-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/client`](./iota-client.mdx) - A client for interacting with IOTA RPC nodes.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/bcs`](bcs.mdx) - A BCS builder with pre-defined types for IOTA.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/transaction`](./transaction-building/basics.mdx) - Utilities for building
    and interacting with transactions.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/keypairs/*`](./cryptography/keypairs.mdx) - Modular exports for specific
    KeyPair implementations.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/verify`](./cryptography/keypairs.mdx#verifying-signatures-without-a-key-pair) -
    Methods for verifying transactions and messages.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/cryptography`](./cryptography/keypairs.mdx) - Shared types and classes
    for cryptography.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/multisig`](./cryptography/multisig.mdx) - Utilities for working with
    multisig signatures.
-   [`@iota/iota-sdk/utils`](./utils.mdx) - Utilities for formatting and parsing various IOTA
    types.
