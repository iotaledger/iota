# Hello IOTA

This basic example introduces you to the IOTA TypeScript SDK. The Node.js example mints IOTA on a IOTA
network and then queries the address to get a sum for the owned IOTA. You don't need to use an IDE to
complete the example, but one like Microsoft Visual Studio Code helps centralize more advanced
projects.

## Before you begin

You need an address on a IOTA development network (Devnet, Testnet, local). If you don't already have
an address, use the [IOTA Client CLI](../../../references/cli/client.mdx) or the
IOTA Wallet browser extension to create one.

You also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) and a package manager like
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to follow this example, so install them on your system if you
haven't already.

## Start a project

Using a Terminal or Console, create a folder on your system (`hello-iota` in this example) and make
it the working directory.

```sh
mkdir hello-iota
cd hello-iota
```

When you use a package manager to install the necessary packages, it downloads the modules to your
`node_modules` folder and adds the references to your `package.json` file, creating the file if it
doesn't already exist. For this example, you need only the IOTA TypeScript SDK:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @iota/iota-sdk
```

Your `package.json` file now has a _dependencies_ section with `@iota/iota-sdk` listed with the
package version number.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@iota/iota-sdk": "^<VERSION_NUMBER>"
}
```

## Get some IOTA for your account

Instead of a 'Hello World' output to your console, this example introduces some IOTA to your wallet
address. You must be on Devnet, Testnet, or a local network to use a faucet for minting IOTA.

Create a new `index.js` file in the root of your project with the following code.

```js
import { getFullnodeUrl, IotaClient } from '@iota/iota-sdk/client';
import { getFaucetHost, requestIotaFromFaucetv1 } from '@iota/iota-sdk/faucet';
import { NANOS_PER_IOTA } from '@iota/iota-sdk/utils';

// replace <YOUR_IOTA_ADDRESS> with your actual address, which is in the form 0x123...
const MY_ADDRESS = '<YOUR_IOTA_ADDRESS>';

// create a new IotaClient object pointing to the network you want to use
const iotaClient = new IotaClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') });

// Convert NANOS to IOTA
const balance = (balance) => {
    return Number.parseInt(balance.totalBalance) / Number(NANOS_PER_IOTA);
};

// store the JSON representation for the IOTA the address owns before using faucet
const iotaBefore = await iotaClient.getBalance({
    owner: MY_ADDRESS,
});

await requestIotaFromFaucetv1({
    // use getFaucetHost to make sure you're using correct faucet address
    // you can also just use the address (see IOTA TypeScript SDK Quick Start for values)
    host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
    recipient: MY_ADDRESS,
});

// store the JSON representation for the IOTA the address owns after using faucet
const iotaAfter = await iotaClient.getBalance({
    owner: MY_ADDRESS,
});

// Output result to console.
console.log(
    `Balance before faucet: ${balance(iotaBefore)} IOTA. Balance after: ${balance(
        iotaAfter,
    )} IOTA. Hello, IOTA!`,
);
```

Save the file, then use Node.js to run it in your Console or Terminal:

```javascript
node index.js
```

The code imports the `requestIotaFromFaucetv1` function from the SDK and calls it to mint IOTA for the
provided address. The code also imports `IotaClient` to create a new client on the IOTA network that
it uses to query the address and output the amount of IOTA the address owns before and after using
the faucet. You can check the total IOTA for your address using the IOTA Wallet or IOTA Client CLI.

You can also use the [IOTA Client CLI](../../cli/client.mdx) to perform client
calls on a IOTA network.
