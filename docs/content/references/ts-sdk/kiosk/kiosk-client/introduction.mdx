# Kiosk Client

Kiosk Client is the base for all Kiosk SDK functionality.

> We recommend you keep only one instance of `KioskClient` throughout your dApp or script. For
> example, in react, you'd use a context to provide the client.

## Creating a kiosk client

You can follow the example to create a `KioskClient`. View next section for usage in custom networks.

```typescript
import { KioskClient } from '@iota/kiosk';
import { getFullnodeUrl, IotaClient, Network } from '@iota/iota-sdk/client';

// We need a IOTA Client. You can re-use the IotaClient of your project
// (it's not recommended to create a new one).
const client = new IotaClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl(Network.Testnet) });

// Now we can use it to create a kiosk Client.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({
    client,
    network: Network.Testnet,
});
```

### Using KioskClient on custom networks

To use all the functionality of Kiosk SDK outside of official networks, use `custom`
as the network, and pass the `packageIds` for the rules and extensions you want to use.

```typescript
// constructing it for custom network use.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({
    client,
    network: Network.Custom,
    packageIds: {
        kioskLockRulePackageId: '0x...',
        royaltyRulePackageId: '0x...',
        personalKioskRulePackageId: '0x...',
        floorPriceRulePackageId: '0x...',
    },
});
```
