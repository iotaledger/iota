title: Iota Environment Setup
description: Get the background information you need before you start developing on Iota. Learn the layout of the Iota monorepository and the suggested development environment for working with Move.
---

Before you start developing with Iota and Move, you should familiarize yourself with how to contribute to Iota, how Iota is structured, what tools and SDKs exist, and what plugins are available to use in your IDE.

## Fork the Iota repository {#fork}

The recommended way to contribute to the Iota repository is to fork the project, make changes on your fork, then submit a pull request (PR). The Iota repository is available on GitHub: https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.

To create a local Iota repository:

1. Go to the [Iota repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota) on GitHub.
1. Click the **Fork** button to create a copy of the repository in your account.

    ![Fork Iota repo](./images/fork.png)

1. In your forked repository on GitHub, click the green `Code <>` button and copy the **HTTPS** URL GitHub provides.

    ![Copy URL](./images/gh-url.png)

1. Open a terminal or console on your system at the location you want to save the repository locally. Type `git clone ` and paste the URL you copied in the previous step and press `Enter`.
1. Type `cd iota` to make `iota` the active directory.

You can use any [branching strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) you prefer on your Iota fork. Make your changes locally and push to your repository, submitting PRs to the official Iota repository from your fork as needed.

:::tip

Be sure to synchronize your fork frequently to keep it up-to-date with active development.

## Iota repository and how to contribute

The Iota repo is a monorepo, containing all the source code that is used to build and run the Iota network, as well as this documentation.

The root folder of the Iota monorepo has the following top-level folders:

- [apps](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/apps): Contains the source code for the main web applications that IOTA Foundation runs, `Iota Wallet`.
- [consensus](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/consensus): Contains the source code of consensus.
- [crates](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/crates): Contains all the Rust crates that are part of the Iota system.
- [dapps](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/dapps): Contains some examples of decentralized applications built on top of Iota, such as Kiosk or Sponsored Transactions.
- [dashboards](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/dashboards): Currently empty.
- [doc](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/doc): Contains deprecated documentation related to Move and Iota.

- [external-crates](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/external-crates): Contains the source code for the Move programming language.
- [kiosk](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/kiosk): Contains the source code of the IOTA Foundation Kiosk extensions and rules, as well as examples.
- [nre](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/nre): Contains information about node and network reliability engineering.
- [scripts](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/scripts): Contains a number of scripts that are used internally.
- [sdk](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/sdk): Contains the source code for different tools and SDKs, such as the Iota TypeScript SDK, Kiosk SDK, BCS, zkLogin, dApp kit, and others.
- [iota-execution](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/iota-execution): Contains the source code responsible for abstracting access to the execution layer.

## Development branches

The Iota repository includes four primary branches: `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`, and `main`.

The `devnet` branch includes the latest stable build of Iota. Choose the `devnet` branch if you want to build or test on Iota Devnet. If you encounter an issue or find a bug, it may already be fixed in the `main` branch. To submit a PR, you should push commits to your fork of the `main` branch.

The `testnet` branch includes the code running on the Iota Testnet network.

The `mainnet` branch includes the code running on the Iota Mainnet network.

The `main` branch includes the most recent changes and updates. Use the `main` branch if you want to contribute to the Iota project or to experiment with cutting-edge functionality. The `main` branch might include unreleased changes and experimental features, so use it at your own risk.
