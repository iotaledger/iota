# Import Code for Documentation

We import code snippets directly from the source code to ensure the documentation is always up-to-date and correct.
To achieve this, we use two tools to either [import code from the IOTA repo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-code-import) or [any other repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saucelabs/theme-github-codeblock).

:::info

These tools only allow the import of complete files or specific lines from a file. So, if the code changes, make sure to update the lines.

:::

## Local Code Import

We use the [`remark-code-import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-code-import) package to reference the code from the IOTA repo.

:::note CI/CD

If you import local code, ensure it is part of a CI/CD workflow so the code gets tested for correctness.

:::

### Usage

Use it like a standard code block, specifying a path to the file you want to import. You can use `rootDir` as a base path to the repository.

````
```rust file=<rootDir>/some-path/to-rust-file.rs
```
````

## Remote Code Import

We use the [`@saucelabs/theme-github-codeblock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saucelabs/theme-github-codeblock) package to reference code from any other repository.

### Usage

Create a code block with the keyword `reference` and add the GitHub link (with specific line numbers) to the file you want to import.

````
```rust reference
https://github.com/some-repo/with-a-great-project/blob/some-branch/some-path/to-rust-file.rs#L7-L41
```
