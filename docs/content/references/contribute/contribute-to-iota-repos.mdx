## Fork IOTA to contribute {#fork-iota-contribute}

To contribute to IOTA source code or documentation, you need only a GitHub account. You can commit updates and then submit a PR directly from the Github website, or create a fork of the repo to your local environment and use your favorite tools to make changes. Always submit PRs to the `main` branch.

See [IOTA Environment Setup](/developer/getting-started/iota-environment.mdx) for instructions on forking the IOTA repository, if necessary.

## Contribute via the IOTA Improvement Proposal (SIP) process {#SIP}

The IOTA Network is an open-source, decentralized, and permissionless protocol that welcomes community contributions. If you have an idea regarding a core protocol upgrade, the best way to make your voice heard is via submitting a IOTA Improvement Proposal (SIP). For more information on SIPs, see [Contribute to IOTA through SIPs](https://blog.iota.io/iota-improvement-proposals-sips/).
