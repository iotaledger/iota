title: IOTA Framework
description: The IOTA framework libraries include Move modules that provide the logic for IOTA and its standards. A Rust process creates the documentation for the modules directly from comments in the code.
---

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

The documentation in this section is created from the Rust `cargo doc` process. The process builds the content from comments in the source code.   

## Framework documentation

The child pages to this topic describe the module members for the following libraries:

<DocCardList/>

## Source code

You can find the source code for these Move modules in the [crates/iota-framework/packages](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/crates/iota-framework/packages) directory in the `iota` repository on GitHub. As previously mentioned, the comments included in the code provide context for the logic defined.

## Crate documentation

You can review the raw `cargo doc` output of the following documentation in the `iota` repository. The .md files are located in the `crates/iota-framework/docs` directory. Online, they are located at https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/main/crates/iota-framework/docs.

## Build documentation locally

The most recent documentation is always available in the `main` branch of the `iota` repository. You shouldn't need to build the documentation locally, but if the need arises you can:

1. Open a terminal or console to the `iota/crates/iota-framework` directory.
1. Run `cargo doc --workspace --exclude "iota-benchmark" --no-deps`.
1. The docs are built to `crates/iota-framework/docs` into their respective subdirectories.

:::info

If the `cargo doc` process does not work as expected, try running `cargo clean` before attempting again.
