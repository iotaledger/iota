title: Iota Bridge
draft: true
---

[Iota Bridge](https://bridge.iota.io/) is the native bridge for the Iota network. Unlike third-party solutions, a native bridge is typically built into the core architecture of a blockchain, ensuring optimal integration and operation. The bridge allows users to move digital assets from one chain to another, preserving security and maintaining interoperability between diverse ecosystems. Iota Bridge is the native bridge on Iota, designed to enhance interoperability between Iota and Ethereum. Iota Bridge enables users to securely and efficiently transfer native and wrapped ETH to and from Iota. The bridge leverages the unique capabilities of the Iota network to offer fast transaction speeds, lower transaction costs, and a decentralized architecture.

You can bridge tokens in the official Iota Bridge website: https://bridge.iota.io/.

## Operation and governance

Iota Bridge is operated and governed by Iota network validators, the same set of validators that secure the Iota network. Bridge transfers and other actions require validator signatures with a minimal threshold of voting power.

Similar to the Iota network, all governance related to the Iota Bridge is done via validator voting.

## Architecture

WIP

## Supported chains and tokens

Iota Bridge supports token bridging between Iota and Ethereum Mainnet with the following supported assets:

| Asset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Ethereum (ETH) | The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, widely used for transactions and smart contract interactions. |
| Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) | Tokenized representation of native ETH. |

You can transfer these assets both to and from the Iota network, utilizing the bridgeâ€™s capabilities to provide fast, secure, and efficient cross-chain transactions.

## Package IDs and contract addresses

The following package IDs and addresses are reserved for the Iota Bridge.

## Audits

There are two audit reports available for Iota Bridge:

## Global limiter {#global-limiter}

A limiter protects the user's funds by constraining the total value of assets leaving Iota Bridge in any 24-hour window. It tracks total value hourly and aggregates values from the previous 24 hours. Therefore, when the limiter cools down, it refreshes every hour.

The limit applies globally and varies per direction. For example, the amount might be different between Ethereum to Iota and Iota to Ethereum.

The limit also impacts the maximal amount of single transfer. Simply put, in one bridge transfer, you cannot move assets worth more than the limit. The bridge frontend might apply stricter restrictions to protect user assets.

The limit per route is governed by the validator committee through voting.

The global limit is currently $8 million from Ethereum to Iota and $5 million from Iota to Etheruem every 24 hours.

## Asset price

Iota Bridge v1 uses static pricing to calculate limits. The price for ETH is configured at $2,600.00. Namely, bridging one ETH consumes $2,600 USD in limit calculation.

The validator committee governs the pricing through voting. It works together with the global limiter to protect user funds.

## Transfer limit

There is no minimal limit for transfer but a tiny fraction might be rounded down. Particularly for native Ethereum (ETH) and wrapped Ethereum (WETH) because of reduced precision of eight decimal places, the value of 10.0000000000000001 (W)ETH is rounded down to 10 (W)ETH.

| Token | Minimal value | 
| --- | --- |
| ETH | 0.00000001 ETH (eight decimal places of precision) |
| WETH | 0.00000001 ETH (eight decimal places of precision) |

The maximum limit per transfer is the global limit in USD value. Namely a user cannot claim assets on the destination chain if the USD value is higher than the global limit. See the [Global limiter section](#global-limiter) for details.
