title: Iota Architecture
---

Iota shares some similarities with other blockchains but is unique in many ways. Use the topics in this section to understand the features that define the Iota network.

## Understand Iota Security

Learn about the mechanisms available to secure on-chain assets, and the assurances Iota provides regarding asset security. Understand Iota Security explores the overall Iota security architecture to ensure the asset types you design leverage Iota to provide a secure experience for asset holders.

Go to [Understand Iota Security](./iota-architecture/iota-security.mdx).

## Life of a Transaction

Life of a Transaction details the transitions that all transactions on Iota go through from creation to finality. This topic also explores some features of the blockchain (like epochs and checkpoints) that play a role in the life of a transaction.

Go to [Life of a Transaction](./iota-architecture/transaction-lifecycle.mdx).

## Consensus

Every transaction on Iota is sequenced by consensus, where validators agree to the same order of execution of the transactions, even if a minority of them are down or are malicious actors that want to harm the network and users.
Iota currently uses the [Mysticeti](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14821) consensus algorithm.

Go to [Consensus](./iota-architecture/consensus.mdx).

## Iota Indexer

Running a Iota indexer offloads data processing from your Full node and stores it in a relational database. This topic explores some of the benefits running an indexer has and points to instruction on how to run your own. 

Go to [Iota Indexer](./iota-architecture/indexer-functions.mdx).

## Protocol Upgrades

The Iota protocol, framework, and execution engine are frequently extended to include new functionality and bug fixes. This functionality is added in the form of new code which is released to validator operators as part of our regular software releases. The Iota protocol, however, requires that all Iota validators agree about the results of executing each transaction.
