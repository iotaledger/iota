# Database Schema

The Indexer pulls checkpoint data from the full node and populates the tables shown in the ERD diagram:

![Database Schema](./database_schema.svg)

> **NOTE**
>
> Since all tables are populated from checkpoint data the entities are closely related, in the `SQL` files the foreign keys are not specified, a manual study of data is needed to understand all relations.
>
> Migrations are generated by diesel cli, the basic schema can be found [schema.rs](src/schema.rs).
> For more in depth understanding of the database tables, go to [migrations](migrations) folder, in the contained `SQL` the indexes, partitions & constraints are declared.
>
> - Tables `objects_history` & `transactions` have partitions, each partition is created based on `checkpoint_sequence_number` (related form the `checkpoints` table) it goes from `0` to `MAXVALUE`
> - `__diesel_schema_migrations` table is managed by `diesel` cli when applying migrations

## Indexes

Below are listed the tables keys with their constraints:

### Checkpoints

- `epoch, sequence_number`
- `checkpoint_digest`

### Events

- `package, tx_sequence_number, event_sequence_number`
- `package, module, tx_sequence_number, event_sequence_number`
- `event_type, text_pattern_ops, tx_sequence_number, event_sequence_number`
- `checkpoint_sequence_number`

### Objects

- `owner_type, owner_id` (WHERE owner_type BETWEEN 1 AND 2 AND owner_id IS NOT NULL)
- `owner_id, coin_type` (WHERE coin_type IS NOT NULL AND owner_type = 1)
- `checkpoint_sequence_number`
- `object_type`

### Objects Snapshot

- `owner_id, coin_type, object_id` (WHERE coin_type IS NOT NULL AND owner_type = 1)
- `owner_type, owner_id, object_id` (WHERE owner_type BETWEEN 1 AND 2 AND owner_id IS NOT NULL)
- `checkpoint_sequence_number`
- `object_type, object_id`

### Objects History

- `checkpoint_sequence_number, owner_type, owner_id` (WHERE owner_type BETWEEN 1 AND 2 AND owner_id IS NOT NULL)
- `checkpoint_sequence_number, owner_id, coin_type` (WHERE coin_type IS NOT NULL AND owner_type = 1)
- `checkpoint_sequence_number, object_type`

### Transactions

- `transaction_kind` (WHERE transaction_kind = 1)
- `transaction_digest`
- `checkpoint_sequence_number`

### Tx Calls

- `package, module, tx_sequence_number`
- `package, module, func, tx_sequence_number`
- `tx_sequence_number`

### Tx Senders, Tx Recipients

- `tx_sequence_number` ASC

## Partitions

Below are listed the tables keys with their constraints:

- **Transactions, Objects History:**
  - `checkpoint_sequence_number` FOR VALUES FROM (0) TO (MAXVALUE)
