# Iota TypeScript SDK Quick Start

The Iota TypeScript SDK is a modular library of tools for interacting with the Iota blockchain. Use it
to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and interact with a Iota or local network.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @iota/iota.js
```

## Network locations

The following table lists the locations for Iota networks.

| Network | Full node                             | faucet                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| local   | `http://127.0.0.1:9000` (default)     | `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas` (default) |
| Devnet  | `https://fullnode.devnet.iota.io:443`  | `https://faucet.devnet.iota.io/gas`    |
| Testnet | `https://fullnode.testnet.iota.io:443` | `https://faucet.testnet.iota.io/gas`   |
| Mainnet | `https://fullnode.mainnet.iota.io:443` | `null`                                |

<Callout type="warning">

Use dedicated nodes/shared services rather than public endpoints for production apps. The public
endpoints maintained by Mysten Labs (`fullnode.<NETWORK>.iota.io:443`) are rate-limited, and support
only 100 requests per 30 seconds or so. Do not use public endpoints in production applications with
high traffic volume.

You can either run your own Full nodes, or outsource this to a professional infrastructure provider
(preferred for apps that have high traffic). You can find a list of reliable RPC endpoint providers
for Iota on the [Iota Dev Portal](https://iota.io/developers#dev-tools) using the **Node Service** tab.

## Migrate to version 0.38.0

The Iota TypeScript SDK was refactored beginning with version 0.38.0. If you are updating from an
earlier version of the SDK, there are some changes you should consider when updating your code.

### Module structure

The Iota TypeScript SDK is now divided into modular components. Before version 0.38.0, you imported
the complete SDK module. Now, you upload the individual packages of the SDK module instead. See the
[Module Packages section](#module-packages) for the list of packages.

### Deprecated classes

The Iota TypeScript SDK deprecates the following classes with version 0.38.0:

-   `JsonRpcProvider` - The `JsonRpcProvider` class is deprecated in favor of the `iotaClient` class
    when creating a client for a Iota network. See
    [Network Interactions with IotaClient](typescript/iota-client) for more information.
-   `SignerWithProver` and `RawSigner` - Key pairs now directly support signing transactions and
    messages without the need of a `Signer` class. See the
    [Key pairs](typescript/cryptography/keypairs) topic for more information.
-   `signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` - This method was not deprecated, but is now part of
    `IotaClient`.
-   `Connection` classes - The `Connection` classes (`Connection`, `devnetConnection`, and so on)
    have been deprecated in favor of using `iotaClient` for establishing the connection. See
    [Network Interactions with IotaClient](typescript/iota-client) for more information.
-   The `superstruct` type definitions for `JsonRPCProvider` types are replaced with generated types
    exported from `@iota/iota.js/client`. The new type definitions are pure TypeScript types that
    you can't use for runtime validation.
-   A more stable JSON-RPC API has reduced the need for many of the SDK "getter" methods, which are
    now deprecated.

### Signing transaction blocks

Signing and sending transaction blocks changes slightly with the deprecation of the `Signer`
pattern. For an example of transaction signing, see the
[Iota Programmable Transaction Blocks Basics](typescript/transaction-building/basics) topic.

### Faucet requests

The ability to request IOTA from a faucet is not part of `IotaClient` as it was with
`JsonRpcProvider`. Instead, you must use the `requestIotaFromFaucetV0` method from
`@iota/iota.js/faucet`. The `@iota/iota.js/faucet` import also provides a `getFaucetHost` method
to retrieve the faucet URL for `localnet`, `testnet`, or `devnet` networks.

```ts
import { getFaucetHost, requestIotaFromFaucetV0 } from '@iota/iota.js/faucet';

await requestIotaFromFaucetV0({
    host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
    recipient: '<IOTA_ADDRESS>',
});
```

## Module packages

The SDK contains a set of modular packages that you can use independently or together. Import just
what you need to keep your code light and compact.

-   [`@iota/iota.js/client`](/typescript/iota-client) - A client for interacting with Iota RPC nodes.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/bcs`](/typescript/bcs) - A BCS builder with pre-defined types for Iota.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/transaction`](/typescript/transaction-building/basics) - Utilities for building
    and interacting with transactions.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/keypairs/*`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs) - Modular exports for specific
    KeyPair implementations.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/verify`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs#verifying-signatures-without-a-key-pair) -
    Methods for verifying transactions and messages.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/cryptography`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs) - Shared types and classes
    for cryptography.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/multisig`](/typescript/cryptography/multisig) - Utilities for working with
    multisig signatures.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/utils`](/typescript/utils) - Utilities for formatting and parsing various Iota
    types.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/faucet`](/typescript/faucet) - Methods for requesting IOTA from a faucet.
-   [`@iota/iota.js/zklogin`](/typescript/zklogin) - Utilities for working with zkLogin. (Note
    @iota/zklogin package also contains zklogin related functionality)
